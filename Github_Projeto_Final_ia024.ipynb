            "MAIN TEXT!!!! The Palici (Παλικοί in Greek), or Palaci, were a pair of indigenous Sicilian chthonic deities in Roman mythology, and to a lesser extent in Greek mythology. They are mentioned in Ovid's Metamorphoses V, 406, and in Virgil's Aeneid IX, 585. Their cult centered on three small lakes that emitted sulphurous vapors in the Palagonia plain, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with geysers and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted. The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain; one legend made the Palici the sons of Zeus, or possibly Hephaestus, by Aetna or Thalia, but another claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity Adranus.\n",

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'Greek mythology', 'contents': 'greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient greeks and a genre of ancient greek folklore. these stories concern the origin and the nature of the world, the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures, and the origins and significance of the ancient greeks\\' own cult and ritual practices. modern scholars study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.\\n\\nthe greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most likely by minoan and mycenaean singers starting in the 18th century\\xa0bc; eventually the myths of the heroes of the trojan war and its aftermath became part of the oral tradition of homer\\'s epic poems, the iliad and the odyssey. two poems by homer\\'s near contemporary hesiod, the theogony and the works and days, contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. myths are also preserved in the homeric hymns, in fragments of epic poems of the epic cycle, in lyric poems, in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century\\xa0bc, in writings of scholars and poets of the hellenistic age, and in texts from the time of the roman empire by writers such as plutarch and pausanias.\\n\\naside from this narrative deposit in ancient greek literature, pictorial representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes featured prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts. geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century\\xa0bc depict scenes from the trojan cycle as well as the adventures of heracles. in the succeeding archaic, classical, and hellenistic periods, homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.\\n\\ngreek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and literature of western civilization and remains part of western heritage and language. poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes.\\nsources.greek mythology is known today primarily from greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the geometric period from to onward. in fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.\\n\\nliterary sources.mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of greek literature. nevertheless, the only general mythographical handbook to survive from greek antiquity was the library of pseudo-apollodorus. this work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional greek mythology and heroic legends. apollodorus of athens lived from to and wrote on many of these topics. his writings may have formed the basis for the collection; however the \"library\" discusses events that occurred long after his death, hence the name pseudo-apollodorus.\\namong the earliest literary sources are homer\\'s two epic poems, the iliad and the odyssey. other poets completed the \"epic cycle\", but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely. despite their traditional name, the \"homeric hymns\" have no direct connection with homer. they are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called lyric age. hesiod, a possible contemporary with homer, offers in his  theogony  (origin of the gods) the fullest account of the earliest greek myths, dealing with the creation of the world; the origin of the gods, titans, and giants; as well as elaborate genealogies, folktales, and etiological myths. hesiod\\'s works and days, a didactic poem about farming life, also includes the myths of prometheus, pandora, and the five ages. the poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world, rendered yet more dangerous by its gods.\\n\\nlyrical poets often took their subjects from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. greek lyric poets, including pindar, bacchylides and simonides, and bucolic poets such as theocritus and bion, relate individual mythological incidents. additionally, myth was central to classical athenian drama. the tragic playwrights aeschylus, sophocles, and euripides took most of their plots from myths of the age of heroes and the trojan war. many of the great tragic stories (e.g. agamemnon and his children, oedipus, jason, medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. the comic playwright aristophanes also used myths, in the birds and the frogs.\\n\\nhistorians herodotus and diodorus siculus, and geographers pausanias and strabo, who traveled throughout the greek world and noted the stories they heard, supplied numerous local myths and legends, often giving little-known alternative versions. herodotus in particular, searched the various traditions presented him and found the historical or mythological roots in the confrontation between greece and the east. herodotus attempted to reconcile origins and the blending of differing cultural concepts.\\n\\nthe poetry of the hellenistic and roman ages was primarily composed as a literary rather than cultic exercise. nevertheless, it contains many important details that would otherwise be lost. this category includes the works of:\\n1. the roman poets ovid, statius, valerius flaccus, seneca and virgil with servius\\'s commentary.\\n2. the greek poets of the late antique period: nonnus, antoninus liberalis, and quintus smyrnaeus.\\n3. the greek poets of the hellenistic period: apollonius of rhodes, callimachus, pseudo-eratosthenes, and parthenius.\\n\\nprose writers from the same periods who make reference to myths include apuleius, petronius, lollianus, and heliodorus. two other important non-poetical sources are the fabulae and astronomica of the roman writer styled as pseudo-hyginus, the imagines of philostratus the elder and philostratus the younger, and the descriptions of callistratus.\\n\\nfinally, a number of byzantine greek writers provide important details of myth, much derived from earlier now lost greek works. these preservers of myth include arnobius, hesychius, the author of the suda, john tzetzes, and eustathius. they often treat mythology from a christian moralizing perspective.\\n\\narchaeological sources.the discovery of the mycenaean civilization by the german amateur archaeologist heinrich schliemann in the nineteenth century, and the discovery of the minoan civilization in crete by the british archaeologist sir arthur evans in the twentieth century, helped to explain many existing questions about homer\\'s epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at mycenaean and minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the linear b script (an ancient form of greek found in both crete and mainland greece) was used mainly to record inventories, although certain names of gods and heroes have been tentatively identified.\\n\\ngeometric designs on pottery of the eighth century\\xa0bc depict scenes from the trojan cycle, as well as the adventures of heracles. these visual representations of myths are important for two reasons. firstly, many greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of heracles, for example, only the cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary literary text. secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. in some cases, the first known representation of a myth in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. in the archaic (), classical (–323\\xa0bc), and hellenistic (323–146\\xa0bc) periods, homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.\\n\\nsurvey of mythic history.greek mythology has changed over time to accommodate the evolution of their culture, of which mythology, both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions, is an index of the changes. in greek mythology\\'s surviving literary forms, as found mostly at the end of the progressive changes, it is inherently political, as gilbert cuthbertson has argued.\\n\\nthe earlier inhabitants of the balkan peninsula were an agricultural people who, using animism, assigned a spirit to every aspect of nature. eventually, these vague spirits assumed human forms and entered the local mythology as gods. when tribes from the north of the balkan peninsula invaded, they brought with them a new pantheon of gods, based on conquest, force, prowess in battle, and violent heroism. other older gods of the agricultural world fused with those of the more powerful invaders or else faded into insignificance.\\n\\nafter the middle of the archaic period, myths about relationships between male gods and male heroes became more and more frequent, indicating the parallel development of pedagogic pederasty (eros paidikos, ), thought to have been introduced around 630\\xa0bc. by the end of the fifth century\\xa0bc, poets had assigned at least one eromenos, an adolescent boy who was their sexual companion, to every important god except ares and to many legendary figures. previously existing myths, such as those of achilles and patroclus, also then were cast in a pederastic light. alexandrian poets at first, then more generally literary mythographers in the early roman empire, often re-adapted stories of greek mythological characters in this fashion.\\n\\nthe achievement of epic poetry was to create story-cycles and, as a result, to develop a new sense of mythological chronology. thus greek mythology unfolds as a phase in the development of the world and of humans. while self-contradictions in these stories make an absolute timeline impossible, an approximate chronology may be discerned. the resulting mythological \"history of the world\" may be divided into three or four broader periods:\\n1. the myths of origin or age of gods (theogonies, \"births of gods\"): myths about the origins of the world, the gods, and the human race.\\n2. the age when gods and mortals mingled freely: stories of the early interactions between gods, demigods, and mortals.\\n3.  the age of heroes (heroic age), where divine activity was more limited. the last and greatest of the heroic legends is the story of the trojan war and after (which is regarded by some researchers as a separate, fourth period).\\n\\nwhile the age of gods often has been of more interest to contemporary students of myth, the greek authors of the archaic and classical eras had a clear preference for the age of heroes, establishing a chronology and record of human accomplishments after the questions of how the world came into being were explained. for example, the heroic iliad and odyssey dwarfed the divine-focused theogony and homeric hymns in both size and popularity. under the influence of homer the \"hero cult\" leads to a restructuring in spiritual life, expressed in the separation of the realm of the gods from the realm of the dead (heroes), of the chthonic from the olympian. in the works and days, hesiod makes use of a scheme of four ages of man (or races): golden, silver, bronze, and iron. these races or ages are separate creations of the gods, the golden age belonging to the reign of cronos, the subsequent races to the creation of zeus. the presence of evil was explained by the myth of pandora, when all of the best of human capabilities, save hope, had been spilled out of her overturned jar. in metamorphoses, ovid follows hesiod\\'s concept of the four ages.\\n\\norigins of the world and the gods.\"myths of origin\" or \"creation myths\" represent an attempt to explain the beginnings of the universe in human language. the most widely accepted version at the time, although a philosophical account of the beginning of things, is reported by hesiod, in his theogony. he begins with chaos, a yawning nothingness. out of the void emerged gaia (the earth) and some other primary divine beings: eros (love), the abyss (the tartarus), and the erebus. without male assistance, gaia gave birth to uranus (the sky) who then fertilized her. from that union were born first the titans—six males: coeus, crius, cronus, hyperion, iapetus, and oceanus; and six females: mnemosyne, phoebe, rhea, theia, themis, and tethys. after cronus was born, gaia and uranus decreed no more titans were to be born. they were followed by the one-eyed cyclopes and the hecatonchires or hundred-handed ones, who were both thrown into tartarus by uranus. this made gaia furious. cronus (\"the wily, youngest and most terrible of gaia\\'s children\"), was convinced by gaia to castrate his father. he did this, and became the ruler of the titans with his sister-wife rhea as his consort, and the other titans became his court.\\n\\na motif of father-against-son conflict was repeated when cronus was confronted by his son, zeus. because cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby\\'s blanket, which cronus ate. when zeus was full grown, he fed cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up rhea\\'s other children, including poseidon, hades, hestia, demeter, and hera, and the stone, which had been sitting in cronus\\'s stomach all this time. zeus then challenged cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. at last, with the help of the cyclopes (whom zeus freed from tartarus), zeus and his siblings were victorious, while cronus and the titans were hurled down to imprisonment in tartarus.\\n\\nzeus was plagued by the same concern, and after a prophecy that the offspring of his first wife, metis, would give birth to a god \"greater than he\", zeus swallowed her. she was already pregnant with athena, however, and she burst forth from his head—fully-grown and dressed for war.\\n\\nthe earliest greek thought about poetry considered the theogonies to be the prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in apollonius\\' argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to hades. when hermes invents the lyre in the homeric hymn to hermes, the first thing he does is sing about the birth of the gods. hesiod\\'s theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet\\'s function, with its long preliminary invocation to the muses. theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to orpheus, musaeus, epimenides, abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. there are indications that plato was familiar with some version of the orphic theogony. a silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. after they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.\\n\\nimages existed on pottery and religious artwork that were interpreted and more likely, misinterpreted in many diverse myths and tales. a few fragments of these works survive in quotations by neoplatonist philosophers and recently unearthed papyrus scraps. one of these scraps, the derveni papyrus now proves that at least in the fifth century\\xa0bc a theogonic-cosmogonic poem of orpheus was in existence.\\n\\nthe first philosophical cosmologists reacted against, or sometimes built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had existed in the greek world for some time. some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of homer and hesiod. in homer, the earth was viewed as a flat disk afloat on the river of oceanus and overlooked by a hemispherical sky with sun, moon, and stars. the sun (helios) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the earth in a golden bowl at night. sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could be addressed in prayers and called to witness oaths. natural fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of hades and his predecessors, home of the dead. influences from other cultures always afforded new themes.\\n\\ngreek pantheon.according to classical-era mythology, after the overthrow of the titans, the new pantheon of gods and goddesses was confirmed. among the principal greek gods were the olympians, residing on mount olympus under the eye of zeus. (the limitation of their number to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea.) besides the olympians, the greeks worshipped various gods of the countryside, the satyr-god pan, nymphs (spirits of rivers), naiads (who dwelled in springs), dryads (who were spirits of the trees), nereids (who inhabited the sea), river gods, satyrs, and others. in addition, there were the dark powers of the underworld, such as the erinyes (or furies), said to pursue those guilty of crimes against blood-relatives. in order to honor the ancient greek pantheon, poets composed the homeric hymns (a group of thirty-three songs). gregory nagy regards \"the larger homeric hymns as simple preludes (compared with theogony), each of which invokes one god\".\\n\\nthe gods of greek mythology are described as having essentially corporeal but ideal bodies. according to walter burkert, the defining characteristic of greek anthropomorphism is that \"the greek gods are persons, not abstractions, ideas or concepts\". regardless of their underlying forms, the ancient greek gods have many fantastic abilities; most significantly, the gods are not affected by disease, and can be wounded only under highly unusual circumstances. the greeks considered immortality as the distinctive characteristic of their gods; this immortality, as well as unfading youth, was insured by the constant use of nectar and ambrosia, by which the divine blood was renewed in their veins.\\n\\neach god descends from his or her own genealogy, pursues differing interests, has a certain area of expertise, and is governed by a unique personality; however, these descriptions arise from a multiplicity of archaic local variants, which do not always agree with one another. when these gods are called upon in poetry, prayer or cult, they are referred to by a combination of their name and epithets, that identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves (e.g., apollo musagetes is \"apollo, [as] leader of the muses\"). alternatively the epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of the god, sometimes thought to be already ancient during the classical epoch of greece.\\n\\nmost gods were associated with specific aspects of life. for example, aphrodite was the goddess of love and beauty, ares was the god of war, hades the ruler of the underworld, and athena the goddess of wisdom and courage. some gods, such as apollo and dionysus, revealed complex personalities and mixtures of functions, while others, such as hestia (literally \"hearth\") and helios (literally \"sun\"), were little more than personifications. the most impressive temples tended to be dedicated to a limited number of gods, who were the focus of large pan-hellenic cults. it was, however, common for individual regions and villages to devote their own cults to minor gods. many cities also honored the more well-known gods with unusual local rites and associated strange myths with them that were unknown elsewhere. during the heroic age, the cult of heroes (or demigods) supplemented that of the gods.\\n\\nage of gods and mortals.bridging the age when gods lived alone and the age when divine interference in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. these were the early days of the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. most of these tales were later told by ovid\\'s metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.\\ntales of love often involve incest, or the seduction or rape of a mortal woman by a male god, resulting in heroic offspring. the stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. in a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the homeric hymn to aphrodite, where the goddess lies with anchises to produce aeneas.\\n\\nthe second type (tales of punishment) involves the appropriation or invention of some important cultural artifact, as when prometheus steals fire from the gods, when tantalus steals nectar and ambrosia from zeus\\' table and gives it to his own subjects—revealing to them the secrets of the gods, when prometheus or lycaon invents sacrifice, when demeter teaches agriculture and the mysteries to triptolemus, or when marsyas invents the aulos and enters into a musical contest with apollo. ian morris considers prometheus\\' adventures as \"a place between the history of the gods and that of man\". an anonymous papyrus fragment, dated to the third century, vividly portrays dionysus\\' punishment of the king of thrace, lycurgus, whose recognition of the new god came too late, resulting in horrific penalties that extended into the afterlife. the story of the arrival of dionysus to establish his cult in thrace was also the subject of an aeschylean trilogy. in another tragedy, euripides\\' the bacchae, the king of thebes, pentheus, is punished by dionysus, because he disrespected the god and spied on his maenads, the female worshippers of the god.\\n\\nin another story, based on an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, demeter was searching for her daughter, persephone, having taken the form of an old woman called doso, and received a hospitable welcome from celeus, the king of eleusis in attica. as a gift to celeus, because of his hospitality, demeter planned to make his son demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.\\n\\nheroic age.the age in which the heroes lived is known as the heroic age. the epic and genealogical poetry created cycles of stories clustered around particular heroes or events and established the family relationships between the heroes of different stories; they thus arranged the stories in sequence. according to ken dowden, \"there is even a saga effect: we can follow the fates of some families in successive generations\".\\n\\nafter the rise of the hero cult, gods and heroes constitute the sacral sphere and are invoked together in oaths and prayers which are addressed to them. burkert notes that \"the roster of heroes, again in contrast to the gods, is never given fixed and final form. great gods are no longer born, but new heroes can always be raised up from the army of the dead.\" another important difference between the hero cult and the cult of gods is that the hero becomes the centre of local group identity.\\n\\nthe monumental events of heracles are regarded as the dawn of the age of heroes. to the heroic age are also ascribed three great events: the argonautic expedition, the theban cycle, and the trojan war.\\n\\nheracles and the heracleidae.some scholars believe that behind heracles\\' complicated mythology there was probably a real man, perhaps a chieftain-vassal of the kingdom of argos. some scholars suggest the story of heracles is an allegory for the sun\\'s yearly passage through the twelve constellations of the zodiac. others point to earlier myths from other cultures, showing the story of heracles as a local adaptation of hero myths already well established. traditionally, heracles was the son of zeus and alcmene, granddaughter of perseus. his fantastic solitary exploits, with their many folk-tale themes, provided much material for popular legend. according to burkert, \"he is portrayed as a sacrificer, mentioned as a founder of altars, and imagined as a voracious eater himself; it is in this role that he appears in comedy,\\n\\nwhile his tragic end provided much material for tragedy—heracles is regarded by thalia papadopoulou as \"a play of great significance in examination of other euripidean dramas\". in art and literature heracles was represented as an enormously strong man of moderate height; his characteristic weapon was the bow but frequently also the club. vase paintings demonstrate the unparalleled popularity of heracles, his fight with the lion being depicted many hundreds of times.\\n\\nheracles also entered etruscan and roman mythology and cult, and the exclamation \"mehercule\" became as familiar to the romans as \"herakleis\" was to the greeks. in italy he was worshipped as a god of merchants and traders, although others also prayed to him for his characteristic gifts of good luck or rescue from danger.\\n\\nheracles attained the highest social prestige through his appointment as official ancestor of the dorian kings. this probably served as a legitimation for the dorian migrations into the peloponnese. hyllus, the eponymous hero of one dorian phyle, became the son of heracles and one of the heracleidae or heraclids (the numerous descendants of heracles, especially the descendants of hyllus—other heracleidae included macaria, lamos, manto, bianor, tlepolemus, and telephus). these heraclids conquered the peloponnesian kingdoms of mycenae, sparta and argos, claiming, according to legend, a right to rule them through their ancestor. their rise to dominance is frequently called the \"dorian invasion\". the lydian and later the macedonian kings, as rulers of the same rank, also became heracleidae.\\n\\nother members of this earliest generation of heroes such as perseus, deucalion, theseus and bellerophon, have many traits in common with heracles. like him, their exploits are solitary, fantastic and border on fairy tale, as they slay monsters such as the chimera and medusa. bellerophon\\'s adventures are commonplace types, similar to the adventures of heracles and theseus. sending a hero to his presumed death is also a recurrent theme of this early heroic tradition, used in the cases of perseus and bellerophon.\\n\\nargonauts.the only surviving hellenistic epic, the argonautica of apollonius of rhodes (epic poet, scholar, and director of the library of alexandria) tells the myth of the voyage of jason and the argonauts to retrieve the golden fleece from the mythical land of colchis. in the argonautica, jason is impelled on his quest by king pelias, who receives a prophecy that a man with one sandal would be his nemesis. jason loses a sandal in a river, arrives at the court of pelias, and the epic is set in motion. nearly every member of the next generation of heroes, as well as heracles, went with jason in the ship argo to fetch the golden fleece. this generation also included theseus, who went to crete to slay the minotaur; atalanta, the female heroine, and meleager, who once had an epic cycle of his own to rival the iliad and odyssey. pindar, apollonius and the bibliotheca endeavor to give full lists of the argonauts.\\n\\nalthough apollonius wrote his poem in the 3rd century\\xa0bc, the composition of the story of the argonauts is earlier than odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of jason (the wandering of odysseus may have been partly founded on it). in ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the black sea to greek commerce and colonization. it was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. the story of medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.\\n\\nhouse of atreus and theban cycle.in between the argo and the trojan war, there was a generation known chiefly for its horrific crimes. this includes the doings of atreus and thyestes at argos. behind the myth of the house of atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of labdacus) lies the problem of the devolution of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. the twins atreus and thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the devolution of power in mycenae.\\n\\nthe theban cycle deals with events associated especially with cadmus, the city\\'s founder, and later with the doings of laius and oedipus at thebes; a series of stories that lead to the eventual pillage of that city at the hands of the seven against thebes and epigoni. (it is not known whether the seven against thebes figured in early epic.) as far as oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at thebes after the revelation that iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children—markedly different from the tale known to us through tragedy (e.g. sophocles\\' oedipus rex) and later mythological accounts.\\n\\ntrojan war and aftermath.greek mythology culminates in the trojan war, fought between greece and troy, and its aftermath. in homer\\'s works, such as the iliad, the chief stories have already taken shape and substance, and individual themes were elaborated later, especially in greek drama. the trojan war also elicited great interest in the roman culture because of the story of aeneas, a trojan hero whose journey from troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become rome, as recounted in virgil\\'s aeneid (book ii of virgil\\'s aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of troy). finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in latin that passed under the names of dictys cretensis and dares phrygius.\\n\\nthe trojan war cycle, a collection of epic poems, starts with the events leading up to the war: eris and the golden apple of kallisti, the judgement of paris, the abduction of helen, the sacrifice of iphigenia at aulis. to recover helen, the greeks launched a great expedition under the overall command of menelaus\\'s brother, agamemnon, king of argos or mycenae, but the trojans refused to return helen. the iliad, which is set in the tenth year of the war, tells of the quarrel between agamemnon and achilles, who was the finest greek warrior, and the consequent deaths in battle of achilles\\' beloved comrade patroclus and priam\\'s eldest son, hector. after hector\\'s death the trojans were joined by two exotic allies, penthesilea, queen of the amazons, and memnon, king of the ethiopians and son of the dawn-goddess eos. achilles killed both of these, but paris then managed to kill achilles with an arrow in the heel. achilles\\' heel was the only part of his body which was not invulnerable to damage by human weaponry. before they could take troy, the greeks had to steal from the citadel the wooden image of pallas athena (the palladium). finally, with athena\\'s help, they built the trojan horse. despite the warnings of priam\\'s daughter cassandra, the trojans were persuaded by sinon, a greek who feigned desertion, to take the horse inside the walls of troy as an offering to athena; the priest laocoon, who tried to have the horse destroyed, was killed by sea-serpents. at night the greek fleet returned, and the greeks from the horse opened the gates of troy. in the total sack that followed, priam and his remaining sons were slaughtered; the trojan women passed into slavery in various cities of greece. the adventurous homeward voyages of the greek leaders (including the wanderings of odysseus and aeneas (the aeneid), and the murder of agamemnon) were told in two epics, the returns (the lost nostoi) and homer\\'s odyssey. the trojan cycle also includes the adventures of the children of the trojan generation (e.g., orestes and telemachus).\\n\\nthe trojan war provided a variety of themes and became a main source of inspiration for ancient greek artists (e.g. metopes on the parthenon depicting the sack of troy); this artistic preference for themes deriving from the trojan cycle indicates its importance to the ancient greek civilization. the same mythological cycle also inspired a series of posterior european literary writings. for instance, trojan medieval european writers, unacquainted with homer at first hand, found in the troy legend a rich source of heroic and romantic storytelling and a convenient framework into which to fit their own courtly and chivalric ideals. twelfth-century authors, such as benoît de sainte-maure (roman de troie [romance of troy, 1154–60]) and joseph of exeter (de bello troiano [on the trojan war, 1183]) describe the war while rewriting the standard version they found in dictys and dares. they thus follow horace\\'s advice and virgil\\'s example: they rewrite a poem of troy instead of telling something completely new.\\n\\nsome of the more famous heroes noted for their inclusion in the trojan war were:\\n\\non the trojan side:\\n- aeneas\\n- hector\\n- paris\\non the greek side:\\n- ajax (there were two ajaxes)\\n- achilles\\n- king agamemnon\\n- menelaus\\n- odysseus\\n\\ngreek and roman conceptions of myth.mythology was at the heart of everyday life in ancient greece. greeks regarded mythology as a part of their history. they used myth to explain natural phenomena, cultural variations, traditional enmities and friendships. it was a source of pride to be able to trace the descent of one\\'s leaders from a mythological hero or a god. few ever doubted that there was truth behind the account of the trojan war in the iliad and odyssey. according to victor davis hanson, a military historian, columnist, political essayist and former classics professor, and john heath, a classics professor, the profound knowledge of the homeric epos was deemed by the greeks the basis of their acculturation. homer was the \"education of greece\" (), and his poetry \"the book\".\\n\\nphilosophy and myth.after the rise of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century\\xa0bc, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a conception of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the thucydidean history). while poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.\\n\\na few radical philosophers like xenophanes of colophon were already beginning to label the poets\\' tales as blasphemous lies in the 6th century\\xa0bc; xenophanes had complained that homer and hesiod attributed to the gods \"all that is shameful and disgraceful among men; they steal, commit adultery, and deceive one another\". this line of thought found its most sweeping expression in plato\\'s republic and laws. plato created his own allegorical myths (such as the vision of er in the republic), attacked the traditional tales of the gods\\' tricks, thefts and adulteries as immoral, and objected to their central role in literature. plato\\'s criticism was the first serious challenge to the homeric mythological tradition, referring to the myths as \"old wives\\' chatter\". for his part aristotle criticized the pre-socratic quasi-mythical philosophical approach and underscored that \"hesiod and the theological writers were concerned only with what seemed plausible to themselves, and had no respect for us ... but it is not worth taking seriously writers who show off in the mythical style; as for those who do proceed by proving their assertions, we must cross-examine them\".\\n\\nnevertheless, even plato did not manage to wean himself and his society from the influence of myth; his own characterization for socrates is based on the traditional homeric and tragic patterns, used by the philosopher to praise the righteous life of his teacher:\\n\\nhanson and heath estimate that plato\\'s rejection of the homeric tradition was not favorably received by the grassroots greek civilization. the old myths were kept alive in local cults; they continued to influence poetry and to form the main subject of painting and sculpture.\\n\\nmore sportingly, the 5th century\\xa0bc tragedian euripides often played with the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his characters injecting notes of doubt. yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor\\'s version of the same or similar myth. euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.\\n\\nhellenistic and roman rationalism.during the hellenistic period, mythology took on the prestige of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. at the same time, the skeptical turn of the classical age became even more pronounced. greek mythographer euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. although his original work (sacred scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by diodorus and lactantius.\\n\\nrationalizing hermeneutics of myth became even more popular under the roman empire, thanks to the physicalist theories of stoic and epicurean philosophy. stoics presented explanations of the gods and heroes as physical phenomena, while the euhemerists rationalized them as historical figures. at the same time, the stoics and the neoplatonists promoted the moral significations of the mythological tradition, often based on greek etymologies. through his epicurean message, lucretius had sought to expel superstitious fears from the minds of his fellow-citizens. livy, too, is skeptical about the mythological tradition and claims that he does not intend to pass judgement on such legends (fabulae). the challenge for romans with a strong and apologetic sense of religious tradition was to defend that tradition while conceding that it was often a breeding-ground for superstition. the antiquarian varro, who regarded religion as a human institution with great importance for the preservation of good in society, devoted rigorous study to the origins of religious cults. in his antiquitates rerum divinarum (which has not survived, but augustine\\'s city of god indicates its general approach) varro argues that whereas the superstitious man fears the gods, the truly religious person venerates them as parents. according to varro, there have been three accounts of deities in the roman society: the mythical account created by poets for theatre and entertainment, the civil account used by people for veneration as well as by the city, and the natural account created by the philosophers. the best state is, adds varro, where the civil theology combines the poetic mythical account with the philosopher\\'s.\\n\\nroman academic cotta ridicules both literal and allegorical acceptance of myth, declaring roundly that myths have no place in philosophy. cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. it is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of hades or the existence of scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. de natura deorum is the most comprehensive summary of cicero\\'s line of thought.\\n\\nsyncretizing trends.in ancient roman times, a new roman mythology was born through syncretization of numerous greek and other foreign gods. this occurred because the romans had little mythology of their own, and inheritance of the greek mythological tradition caused the major roman gods to adopt characteristics of their greek equivalents. the gods zeus and jupiter are an example of this mythological overlap. in addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions, the association of the romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations. for instance, the cult of sun was introduced in rome after aurelian\\'s successful campaigns in syria. the asiatic divinities mithras (that is to say, the sun) and ba\\'al were combined with apollo and helios into one sol invictus, with conglomerated rites and compound attributes. apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with helios or even dionysus, but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments. the traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice. the worship of sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by christianity.\\n\\nthe surviving 2nd-century collection of orphic hymns (second century ad) and the saturnalia of macrobius ambrosius theodosius (fifth century) are influenced by the theories of rationalism and the syncretizing trends as well. the orphic hymns are a set of pre-classical poetic compositions, attributed to orpheus, himself the subject of a renowned myth. in reality, these poems were probably composed by several different poets, and contain a rich set of clues about prehistoric european mythology. the stated purpose of the saturnalia is to transmit the hellenic culture macrobius has derived from his reading, even though much of his treatment of gods is colored by egyptian and north african mythology and theology (which also affect the interpretation of virgil). in saturnalia reappear mythographical comments influenced by the euhemerists, the stoics and the neoplatonists.\\n\\nmodern interpretations.the genesis of modern understanding of greek mythology is regarded by some scholars as a double reaction at the end of the eighteenth century against \"the traditional attitude of christian animosity\", in which the christian reinterpretation of myth as a \"lie\" or fable had been retained. in germany, by about 1795, there was a growing interest in homer and greek mythology. in göttingen, johann matthias gesner began to revive greek studies, while his successor, christian gottlob heyne, worked with johann joachim winckelmann, and laid the foundations for mythological research both in germany and elsewhere.\\n\\ncomparative and psychoanalytic approaches.the development of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established the science of myth. since the romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. wilhelm mannhardt, james frazer, and stith thompson employed the comparative approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. in 1871 edward burnett tylor published his primitive culture, in which he applied the comparative method and tried to explain the origin and evolution of religion. tylor\\'s procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both carl jung and joseph campbell. max müller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of aryan nature worship. bronisław malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. claude lévi-strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world.\\n\\nsigmund freud introduced a transhistorical and biological conception of man and a view of myth as an expression of repressed ideas. dream interpretation is the basis of freudian myth interpretation and freud\\'s concept of dreamwork recognizes the importance of contextual relationships for the interpretation of any individual element in a dream. this suggestion would find an important point of rapprochement between the structuralist and psychoanalytic approaches to myth in freud\\'s thought. carl jung extended the transhistorical, psychological approach with his theory of the \"collective unconscious\" and the archetypes (inherited \"archaic\" patterns), often encoded in myth, that arise out of it. according to jung, \"myth-forming structural elements must be present in the unconscious psyche\". comparing jung\\'s methodology with joseph campbell\\'s theory, robert a. segal concludes that \"to interpret a myth campbell simply identifies the archetypes in it. an interpretation of the odyssey, for example, would show how odysseus\\'s life conforms to a heroic pattern. jung, by contrast, considers the identification of archetypes merely the first step in the interpretation of a myth\". karl kerényi, one of the founders of modern studies in greek mythology, gave up his early views of myth, in order to apply jung\\'s theories of archetypes to greek myth.\\n\\norigin theories.max müller attempted to understand an indo-european religious form by tracing it back to its indo-european (or, in müller\\'s time, \"aryan\") \"original\" manifestation. in 1891, he claimed that \"the most important discovery which has been made during the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind ... was this sample equation: sanskrit dyaus-pitar = greek zeus = latin jupiter = old norse tyr\". the question of greek mythology\\'s place in indo-european studies has generated much scholarship since müller\\'s time. for example, philologist georges dumézil draws a comparison between the greek uranus and the sanskrit varuna, although there is no hint that he believes them to be originally connected. in other cases, close parallels in character and function suggest a common heritage, yet lack of linguistic evidence makes it difficult to prove, as in the case of the greek moirai and the norns of norse mythology.\\n\\nit appears that the mycenaean religion was the mother of the greek religion and its pantheon already included many divinities that can be found in classical greece. however, greek mythology is generally seen as having heavy influence of pre-greek and near eastern cultures, and as such contains few important elements for the reconstruction of the proto-indo-european religion. consequently, greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention in the context of indo-european comparative mythology until the mid 2000s.\\n\\narchaeology and mythography have revealed influence from asia minor and the near east. adonis seems to be the greek counterpart—more clearly in cult than in myth—of a near eastern \"dying god\". cybele is rooted in anatolian culture while much of aphrodite\\'s iconography may spring from semitic goddesses. there are also possible parallels between the earliest divine generations (chaos and its children) and tiamat in the enuma elish. according to meyer reinhold, \"near eastern theogonic concepts, involving divine succession through violence and generational conflicts for power, found their way ... into greek mythology\".\\n\\nin addition to indo-european and near eastern origins, some scholars have speculated on the debts of greek mythology to the indigenous pre-greek societies: crete, mycenae, pylos, thebes and orchomenus. historians of religion were fascinated by a number of apparently ancient configurations of myth connected with crete (the god as bull, zeus and europa, pasiphaë who yields to the bull and gives birth to the minotaur, etc.). martin p. nilsson asserts, based on the representations and general function of the gods, that a lot of minoan gods and religious conceptions were fused in the mycenaean religion. and concluded that all great classical greek myths were tied to mycenaean centres and anchored in prehistoric times. nevertheless, according to burkert, the iconography of the cretan palace period has provided almost no confirmation for these theories.\\n\\nmotifs in western art and literature.the widespread adoption of christianity did not curb the popularity of the myths. with the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the renaissance, the poetry of ovid became a major influence on the imagination of poets, dramatists, musicians and artists. from the early years of renaissance, artists such as leonardo da vinci, michelangelo, and raphael, portrayed the pagan subjects of greek mythology alongside more conventional christian themes. through the medium of latin and the works of ovid, greek myth influenced medieval and renaissance poets such as petrarch, boccaccio and dante in italy.\\n\\nin northern europe, greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. the english imagination was fired by greek mythology starting with chaucer and john milton and continuing through shakespeare to robert bridges in the 20th century. racine in france and goethe in germany revived greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. although during the enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against greek myth spread throughout europe, the myths continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of handel\\'s and mozart\\'s operas.\\n\\nby the end of the 18th century, romanticism initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things greek, including greek mythology. in britain, new translations of greek tragedies and homer inspired contemporary poets (such as alfred lord tennyson, keats, byron and shelley) and painters (such as lord leighton and lawrence alma-tadema). christoph gluck, richard strauss, jacques offenbach and many others set greek mythological themes to music. american authors of the 19th century, such as thomas bulfinch and nathaniel hawthorne, held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of english and american literature. in more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by dramatists jean anouilh, jean cocteau, and jean giraudoux in france, eugene o\\'neill in america, and t. s. eliot in britain and by novelists such as james joyce and andré gide.\\n\\nprimary sources (greek and roman).- aeschylus, the persians. see

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'Zeus', 'contents': 'zeus (british english , north american english ; , zeús ) is the sky and thunder god in ancient greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of mount olympus. his name is cognate with the first element of his roman equivalent jupiter. his mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of indo-european deities such as jupiter, perkūnas, perun, indra and thor.\\n\\nzeus is the child of cronus and rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from cronus\\'s stomach. in most traditions, he is married to hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered ares, hebe, and hephaestus. at the oracle of dodona, his consort was said to be dione, by whom the iliad states that he fathered aphrodite. zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. these resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, including athena, apollo, artemis, hermes, persephone, dionysus, perseus, heracles, helen of troy, minos, and the muses.\\n\\nhe was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: \"even the gods who are not his natural children address him as father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" he was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting pausanias to observe \"that zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". zeus\\' symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. in addition to his indo-european inheritance, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\" (greek: , nephelēgereta) also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient near east, such as the scepter. zeus is frequently depicted by greek artists in one of two poses: standing, striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand, or seated in majesty.\\n\\nname.the god\\'s name in the nominative is (zeús). it is inflected as follows: vocative: (); accusative: (); genitive: (); dative: (). diogenes laërtius quotes pherecydes of syros as spelling the name, .\\n\\nzeus is the greek continuation of *, the name of the proto-indo-european god of the daytime sky, also called *\\' (\"sky father\"). the god is known under this name in the rigveda (vedic sanskrit dyaus/dyaus pita), latin (compare jupiter, from iuppiter, deriving from the proto-indo-european vocative *\\'), deriving from the root *dyeu- (\"to shine\", and in its many derivatives, \"sky, heaven, god\").\\nzeus is the only deity in the olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent indo-european etymology.\\n\\nthe earliest attested forms of the name are the mycenaean greek , di-we and , di-wo, written in the linear b syllabic script.\\n\\nplato, in his cratylus, gives a folk etymology of zeus meaning \"cause of life always to all things,\" because of puns between alternate titles of zeus (zen and dia) with the greek words for life and \"because of.\" this etymology, along with plato\\'s entire method of deriving etymologies, is not supported by modern scholarship.\\n\\nbirth.cronus sired several children by rhea: hestia, demeter, hera, hades, and poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from gaia and uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by his son as he had previously overthrown uranus, his own father, an oracle that rhea heard and wished to avert.\\n\\nwhen zeus was about to be born, rhea sought gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that cronus would get his retribution for his acts against uranus and his own children. rhea gave birth to zeus in crete, handing cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed.\\n\\ninfancy.varying versions of the story exist:\\n\\n1. according to hyginus (fabulae, 139)) zeus was raised by a nymph named amalthea. since saturn (cronus) ruled over the earth, the heavens and the sea, she hid him by dangling him on a rope from a tree so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.\\n2. according to pseudo-apollodorus (bibliotheca, 1.1.5-7)) zeus was raised by a goat named amalthea in a cave called dictaeon antron (psychro cave). a a company of soldiers called kouretes danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that cronus would not hear the baby\\'s cry.\\n\\nking of the gods.after reaching manhood, zeus forced cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at pytho under the glens of parnassus to be a sign to mortal men, the omphalos) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. in some versions, metis gave cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the babies, or zeus cut cronus\\'s stomach open. then zeus released the brothers of cronus, the hecatonchires and the cyclopes, from their dungeon in tartarus, killing their guard, campe.\\n\\nas a token of their appreciation, the cyclopes gave him thunder and the thunderbolt, or lightning, which had previously been hidden by gaia. together, zeus, his brothers and sisters, hecatonchires and cyclopes overthrew cronus and the other titans, in the combat called the titanomachy. the defeated titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as tartarus. atlas, one of the titans who fought against zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.\\n\\nafter the battle with the titans, zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, poseidon and hades, by drawing lots: zeus got the sky and air, poseidon the waters, and hades the world of the dead (the underworld). the ancient earth, gaia, could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and hades claimed the humans who died (see also penthus).\\n\\ngaia resented the way zeus had treated the titans, because they were her children. soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, zeus had to fight some of gaia\\'s other children, the monsters typhon and echidna. he vanquished typhon and trapped him under mount etna, but left echidna and her children alive.\\n\\nconflicts with humans.when zeus was atop mount olympus he was appalled by human sacrifice and other signs of human decadence. he decided to wipe out mankind and flooded the world with the help of his brother poseidon. after the flood, only deucalion and pyrrha remained. this flood narrative is a common motif in mythology.\\n\\nthroughout history zeus has been depicted as using violence to get his way and terrorize humans. as god of the sky he has the power to hurl lightning bolts as a weapon. since lightning is quite powerful and sometimes deadly, it is a bold sign when lightning strikes because it is known that zeus most likely threw the bolt.\\n\\nin the iliad.the iliad is a poem by homer about the trojan war and the battle over the city of troy, in which zeus plays a major part.\\n\\nscenes in which zeus appears include:\\n\\n- book 2: zeus sends agamemnon a dream and is able to partially control his decisions because of the effects of the dream\\n- book 4: zeus promises hera to ultimately destroy the city of troy at the end of the war\\n- book 7: zeus and poseidon ruin the achaeans fortress\\n- book 8: zeus prohibits the other gods from fighting each other and has to return to mount ida where he can think over his decision that the greeks will lose the war\\n- book 14: zeus is seduced by hera and becomes distracted while she helps out the greeks\\n- book 15: zeus wakes up and realizes that poseidon his own brother has been helping out the greeks, while also sending hector and apollo to help fight the trojans ensuring that the city of troy will fall\\n- book 16: zeus is upset that he couldn\\'t help save sarpedon\\'s life because it would then contradict his previous decisions\\n- book 17: zeus is emotionally hurt by the fate of hector\\n- book 20: zeus lets the other gods help out their respective sides in the war\\n- book 24: zeus demands that achilles release the corpse of hector to be buried honourably\\n\\nlist of other deeds.- zeus granted callirrhoe\\'s prayer that her sons by alcmaeon, acarnan and amphoterus, grow quickly so that they might be able to avenger the death of their father by the hands of phegeus and his two sons.\\n- he unsuccessfully wooed thetis, daughter of nereus.\\n\\nzeus and hera.zeus was brother and consort of hera. by hera, zeus sired ares, hebe and hephaestus, though some accounts say that hera produced these offspring alone. some also include eileithyia, eris, enyo and angelos as their daughters. in the section of the iliad known to scholars as the deception of zeus, the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it. the conquests of zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of hellenic dynasties are famous. olympian mythography even credits him with unions with leto, demeter, metis, themis, eurynome and mnemosyne. other relationships with immortals included dione and maia. among mortals were semele, io, europa and leda (for more details, see below) and with the young ganymede (although he was mortal zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality).\\n\\nmany myths render hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of zeus\\' mistresses and their children by him. for a time, a nymph named echo had the job of distracting hera from his affairs by talking incessantly, and when hera discovered the deception, she cursed echo to repeat the words of others.\\n\\nconsorts and offspring.the greeks variously claimed that the moires/fates were the daughters of zeus and the titaness themis or of primordial beings like chaos, nyx, or ananke.\\n\\nthe charites/graces were usually considered the daughters of zeus and eurynome but they were also said to be daughters of dionysus and aphrodite or of helios and the naiad aegle.\\n\\nsome accounts say that ares, hebe, and hephaestus were born parthenogenetically.\\n\\naccording to one version, athena is said to be born parthenogenetically.\\n\\nhelen was either the daughter of leda or nemesis.\\n\\ntyche is usually considered a daughter of aphrodite and hermes.\\n\\nroles and epithets.zeus played a dominant role, presiding over the greek olympian pantheon. he fathered many of the heroes and was featured in many of their local cults. though the homeric \"cloud collector\" was the god of the sky and thunder like his near-eastern counterparts, he was also the supreme cultural artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of greek religious beliefs and the archetypal greek deity.\\n\\naside from local epithets that simply designated the deity as doing something random at some particular place, the epithets or titles applied to zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:\\n\\n- zeus aegiduchos or aegiochos: usually taken as zeus as the bearer of the aegis, the divine shield with the head of medusa across it, although others derive it from \"goat\" () and okhē () in reference to zeus\\' nurse, the divine goat amalthea.\\n- zeus agoraeus: zeus as patron of the marketplace (agora) and punisher of dishonest traders.\\n- zeus areius: either \"warlike\" or \"the atoning one\".\\n- zeus horkios: zeus as keeper of oaths. exposed liars were made to dedicate a votive statue to zeus, often at the sanctuary at olympia\\n- zeus olympios: zeus as king of the gods and patron of the panhellenic games at olympia\\n- zeus panhellenios (\"zeus of all the greeks\"): worshipped at aeacus\\'s temple on aegina\\n- zeus xenios, philoxenon, or hospites: zeus as the patron of hospitality (xenia) and guests, avenger of wrongs done to strangers\\n\\nadditional names and epithets for zeus are also:\\n\\n- abrettenus (ἀβρεττηνός) or abretanus: surname of zeus in mysia\\n- achad: one of his names in syria.\\n- acraeus: his name at smyrna.\\n- acrettenus: his name in mysia.\\n- adad: one of his names in syria.\\n- adultus: from his being invoked by adults, on their marriage.\\n- apemius: zeus as the averter of ills\\n- apomyius zeus as one who dispels flies\\n- astrapios (\"lightninger\"): zeus as a weather god\\n- bottiaeus: worshipped at antioch\\n- brontios (\"thunderer\"): zeus as a weather god\\n- diktaios: zeus as lord of the dikte mountain range, worshipped from mycenaean times on crete\\n- ithomatas: worshipped at mount ithome in messenia\\n- zeus adados: a hellenization of the canaanite hadad and assyrian adad, particularly his solar cult at heliopolis\\n- zeus bouleus: worshipped at dodona, the earliest oracle, along with zeus naos\\n- zeus georgos (, \"zeus the farmer\"): zeus as god of crops and the harvest, worshipped in athens\\n- zeus helioupolites (\"heliopolite\" or \"heliopolitan zeus\"): a hellenization of the canaanite baʿal (probably hadad) worshipped as a sun god at heliopolis (modern baalbek)\\n- zeus kasios (\"zeus of mount kasios\" the modern jebel aqra): worshipped at a site on the syrian–turkish border, a hellenization of the canaanite mountain and weather god baal zephon\\n- zeus labrandos (\"zeus of labraunda\"): worshiped at caria, depicted with a double-edged axe (labrys), a hellenization of the hurrian weather god teshub\\n- zeus meilichios (\"zeus the easily-entreated\"): worshipped at athens, a form of the archaic chthonic daimon meilichios\\n- zeus naos: worshipped at dodona, the earliest oracle, along with zeus bouleus\\n- zeus tallaios (\"solar zeus\"): worshipped on crete\\n\\npanhellenic cults. major center where all greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was olympia. their quadrennial festival featured the famous games. there was also an altar to zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries\\' worth of animals sacrificed there.\\n\\noutside of the major inter-polis sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping zeus precisely shared across the greek world. most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of greek temples from asia minor to sicily. certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\\n\\nzeus velchanos.with one exception, greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of zeus as crete. minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", will durant observed, and cretan zeus retained his youthful minoan features. the local child of the great mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\", whose minoan name the greeks hellenized as velchanos, was in time assumed as an epithet by zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in crete as zeus velchanos (\"boy-zeus\"), often simply the kouros.\\n\\nin crete, zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at knossos, ida and palaikastro. in the hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to zeus velchanos was founded at the hagia triada site of a long-ruined minoan palace. broadly contemporary coins from phaistos show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees. on other cretan coins velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage. inscriptions at gortyn and lyttos record a velchania festival, showing that velchanios was still widely venerated in hellenistic crete.\\n\\nthe stories of minos and epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings and priests. the dramatic setting of plato\\'s laws is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic cretan knowledge. on crete, zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ho megas kouros, \"the great youth\". ivory statuettes of the \"divine boy\" were unearthed near the labyrinth at knossos by sir arthur evans. with the kouretes, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the cretan paideia.\\n\\nthe myth of the death of cretan zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, callimachus, together with the assertion of antoninus liberalis that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a mythic swarm of bees, suggests that velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.\\nthe hellenistic writer euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that zeus had actually been a great king of crete and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. the works of euhemerus himself have not survived, but christian patristic writers took up the suggestion.\\n\\nzeus lykaios.the epithet zeus lykaios (\"wolf-zeus\") is assumed by zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the lykaia on the slopes of mount lykaion (\"wolf mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic arcadia; zeus had only a formal connection with the rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage with an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the ephebes who were the participants. near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.\\n\\naccording to plato, a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to zeus lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal\\'s. whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. there were games associated with the lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of arcadia, megalopolis; there the major temple was dedicated to zeus lykaios.\\n\\nthere is, however, the crucial detail that lykaios or lykeios (epithets of zeus and apollo) may derive from proto-greek *, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as , \"twilight\", , \"year\" (lit. \"light\\'s course\") etc. this, cook argues, brings indeed much new \\'light\\' to the matter as achaeus, the contemporary tragedian of sophocles, spoke of zeus lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this zeus lykaios may just be the arcadian zeus, son of aether, described by cicero. again under this new signification may be seen pausanias\\' descriptions of lykosoura being \\'the first city that ever the sun beheld\\', and of the altar of zeus, at the summit of mount lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and \\'facing the sun-rise\\'. further cook sees only the tale of zeus\\' sacred precinct at mount lykaion allowing no shadows referring to zeus as \\'god of light\\' (lykaios).\\n\\nadditional cults of zeus.although etymology indicates that zeus was originally a sky god, many greek cities honored a local zeus who lived underground. athenians and sicilians honored zeus meilichios (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had zeus chthonios (\"earthy\"), zeus katachthonios (\"under-the-earth\") and zeus plousios (\"wealth-bringing\"). these deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. they also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did chthonic deities like persephone and demeter, and also the heroes at their tombs. olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\\n\\nin some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the daimon to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground zeus. thus the shrine at lebadaea in boeotia might belong to the hero trophonius or to zeus trephonius (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe pausanias, or strabo. the hero amphiaraus was honored as zeus amphiaraus at oropus outside of thebes, and the spartans even had a shrine to zeus agamemnon. ancient molossian kings sacrificed to zeus areius. strabo mention that at tralles there was the zeus larisaeus.\\n\\nnon-panhellenic cults.in addition to the panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. with the epithet zeus aetnaeus he was worshiped on mount aetna, where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the aetnaea in his honor. other examples are listed below. as zeus aeneius or zeus aenesius, he was worshiped in the island of cephalonia, where he had a temple on mount aenos.\\n\\noracles of zeus.although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to apollo, the heroes, or various goddesses like themis, a few oracular sites were dedicated to zeus. in addition, some foreign oracles, such as baʿal\\'s at heliopolis, were associated with zeus in greek or jupiter in latin.\\n\\nthe oracle at dodona.the cult of zeus at dodona in epirus, where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium bc onward, centered on a sacred oak. when the odyssey was composed (circa 750 bc), divination was done there by barefoot priests called selloi, who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches. by the time herodotus wrote about dodona, female priestesses called peleiades (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\\n\\nzeus\\' consort at dodona was not hera, but the goddess dione — whose name is a feminine form of \"zeus\". her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\\n\\nthe oracle at siwa.the oracle of ammon at the siwa oasis in the western desert of egypt did not lie within the bounds of the greek world before alexander\\'s day, but it already loomed large in the greek mind during the archaic era: herodotus mentions consultations with zeus ammon in his account of the persian war. zeus ammon was especially favored at sparta, where a temple to him existed by the time of the peloponnesian war.\\n\\nafter alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at siwa, the figure arose in the hellenistic imagination of a libyan sibyl.\\n\\nzeus and foreign gods.zeus was identified with the roman god jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination (see interpretatio graeca) with various other deities, such as the egyptian ammon and the etruscan tinia. he, along with dionysus, absorbed the role of the chief phrygian god sabazios in the syncretic deity known in rome as sabazius. the seleucid ruler antiochus iv epiphanes erected a statue of zeus olympios in the judean temple in jerusalem. hellenizing jews referred to this statue as baal shamen (in english, lord of heaven).\\n\\nzeus and the sun.zeus is occasionally conflated with the hellenic sun god, helios, who is sometimes either directly referred to as zeus\\' eye, or clearly implied as such. hesiod, for instance, describes zeus\\' eye as effectively the sun. this perception is possibly derived from earlier proto-indo-european religion, in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of *dyḗus pḥtḗr (see hvare-khshaeta).\\n\\nthe cretan zeus tallaios had solar elements to his cult. \"talos\" was the local equivalent of helios.\\n\\nzeus in philosophy.in neoplatonism, zeus\\' relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the demiurge or divine mind. specifically within plotinus\\'s work the enneads and the platonic theology of proclus.\\n\\nzeus in the bible.zeus is mentioned in the new testament twice, first in acts 14:8–13: when the people living in lystra saw the apostle paul heal a lame man, they considered paul and his partner barnabas to be gods, identifying paul with hermes and barnabas with zeus, even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd. two ancient inscriptions discovered in 1909 near lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city. one of the inscriptions refers to the \"priests of zeus\", and the other mentions \"hermes most great\"\" and \"zeus the sun-god\".\\n\\nthe second occurrence is in acts 28:11: the name of the ship in which the prisoner paul set sail from the island of malta bore the figurehead \"sons of zeus\" aka castor and pollux.\\n\\nthe deuterocanonical book of 2 maccabees 6:1, 2 talks of king antiochus iv (epiphanes), who in his attempt to stamp out the jewish religion, directed that the temple at jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to zeus (jupiter olympius).\\n\\nin modern culture.depictions of zeus as a bull, the form he took when abducting europa, are found on the greek 2-euro coin and on the united kingdom identity card for visa holders. mary beard, professor of classics at cambridge university, has criticised this for its apparent celebration of rape.\\n\\nzeus has been portrayed by axel ringvall in jupiter på jorden, the first known film adaption to feature zeus; niall macginnis in jason and the argonauts and angus macfadyen in the 2000 remake; laurence olivier in the original clash of the titans, and liam neeson in the 2010 remake, along with the 2012 sequel wrath of the titans; anthony quinn in the 1990s tv series ; rip torn in the disney animated feature hercules; corey burton in hercules, god of war ii, god of war iii, , playstation all-stars battle royale, and kingdom hearts 3; and sean bean in  (2010).\\n\\nsee also.- achaean league\\n- agetor\\n- ambulia -

He saw action in the Italian conquest of Libya and in the First World War. During this conflict, he gave an important contribution to the creation and training of the \"Arditi\", elite infantry units, and with the rank of maggiore was the commander of the IX Nono Reparto Arditi that fought in the zone of Monte Grappa. Emerging considerably decorated from these conflicts, he became aide-de-camp to King Victor Emmanuel III, holding this post from 1923 to 1927.

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'World War I', 'contents': 'world war i (often abbreviated as wwi or ww1), also known as the first world war, the great war, the seminal catastrophe, and initially in north america as the european war, was a global war originating in europe that lasted from 28 july 1914 to 11 november 1918. contemporaneously described as \"the war to end all wars\", it led to the mobilisation of more than 70\\xa0million military personnel, including 60 million europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. it is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war, while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide.\\n\\non 28 june 1914, gavrilo princip, a bosnian serb yugoslav nationalist, assassinated the austro-hungarian heir archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo, leading to the july crisis. in response, on 23 july austria-hungary issued an ultimatum to serbia. serbia\\'s reply failed to satisfy the austrians, and the two moved to a war footing.\\n\\na network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the balkans to one involving most of europe. by july 1914, the great powers of europe were divided into two coalitions: the triple entente—consisting of france, russia, and britain—and the triple alliance of germany, austria-hungary, and italy (the triple alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing italy to stay out of the war until april 1915, when it joined the allied powers after its relations with austria-hungary deteriorated). russia felt it necessary to back serbia and, after austria-hungary shelled the serbian capital of belgrade on the 28july, approved partial mobilisation. full russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30july; on the 31st, austria-hungary and germany did the same, while germany demanded russia demobilise within twelve hours. when russia failed to comply, germany declared war on russia on 1august in support of austria-hungary, with austria-hungary following suit on 6august; france ordered full mobilisation in support of russia on 2august.\\n\\ngerman strategy for a war on two fronts against france and russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the west to defeat france within six weeks, then shift forces to the east before russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the schlieffen plan. on 2august, germany demanded free passage through belgium, an essential element in achieving a quick victory over france. when this was refused, german forces invaded belgium on 3august and declared war on france the same day; the belgian government invoked the 1839 treaty of london and in compliance with its obligations under this, britain declared war on germany on 4august. on 12 august, britain and france also declared war on austria-hungary; on the 23august, japan sided with britain, seizing german possessions in china and the pacific. in november 1914, the ottoman empire entered the war on the side of the central powers, opening fronts in the caucasus, mesopotamia, and the sinai peninsula. the war was fought in and drew upon each power\\'s colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to africa and across the globe. the entente and its allies would eventually become known as the allied powers, while the grouping of austria-hungary, germany and their allies would become known as the central powers.\\n\\nthe german advance into france was halted at the battle of the marne and by the end of 1914, the western front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 (the eastern front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). in 1915, italy joined the allied powers and opened a front in the alps. bulgaria joined the central powers in 1915 and greece joined the allies in 1917, expanding the war in the balkans. the united states initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war materiel to the allies. eventually, after the sinking of american merchant ships by german submarines, the declaration by germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and the revelation that germany was trying to incite mexico to make war on the united states, the u.s. declared war on germany on 6april 1917. trained american forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the american expeditionary force would reach some two million troops.\\n\\nthough serbia was defeated in 1915, and romania joined the allied powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917, none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. the 1917 february revolution in russia replaced the tsarist autocracy with the provisional government, but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the october revolution, the creation of the soviet socialist republic, and the signing of the treaty of brest-litovsk by the new government in march 1918, ending russia\\'s involvement in the war. this allowed the transfer of large numbers of german troops from the east to the western front, resulting in the spring offensive. this attack was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the german reserves. the allies held their lines and attacked in the final major battle of the war, the hundred days offensive, a continual series of attacks to which the germans had no reply. bulgaria was the first central power to sign an armistice—the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918. on 30 october, the ottoman empire capitulated, signing the armistice of mudros. on 4november, the austro-hungarian empire agreed to the armistice of villa giusti. with its allies defeated, revolution at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, kaiser wilhelm abdicated on 9november and germany signed an armistice on 11 november 1918, effectively ending the war.\\n\\nworld war i was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. it is considered to mark the end of the second industrial revolution and the pax britannica. the war and its immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings. the big four (britain, france, the united states, and italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 paris peace conference, the most well known being the german peace treaty—the treaty of versailles. ultimately, as a result of the war the austro-hungarian, german, ottoman, and russian empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains. however, despite the conclusive allied victory (and the creation of the league of nations during the peace conference, intended to prevent future wars), a second world war would follow just over twenty years later.\\nnames.the term \"first world war\" was first used in september 1914 by german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared \\'european war\\'\\xa0... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" citing a wire service report in the indianapolis star on 20 september 1914.\\n\\nprior to world war ii, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the great war or simply the world war. in october 1914, the canadian magazine maclean\\'s wrote, \"some wars name themselves. this is the great war.\" contemporary europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" or \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale and devastation. after world warii began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with british empire historians, including canadians, favouring \"the first world war\" and americans \"world wari\".\\n\\npolitical and military alliances.for much of the 19th century, the major european powers had tried to maintain a tenuous balance of power among themselves, resulting in a complex network of political and military alliances. the biggest challenges to this were britain\\'s withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the ottoman empire and the post-1848 rise of prussia under otto von bismarck. victory in the 1866 austro-prussian war established prussian hegemony in germany, while victory over france in the 1870–1871 franco-prussian war unified the german states into a german reich under prussian leadership.\\n\\nin 1873, to isolate france and avoid a war on two fronts, bismarck negotiated the league of the three emperors (german: dreikaiserbund) between austria-hungary, russia and germany. concerned by russia\\'s victory in the 1877–1878 russo-turkish war and their influence in the balkans, the league was dissolved in 1878, with germany and austria-hungary subsequently forming the 1879 dual alliance; this became the triple alliance when italy joined in 1882.\\n\\nthe practical details of these alliances were limited, since their primary purpose was to ensure cooperation between the three imperial powers and isolate france. attempts by britain in 1880 to resolve colonial tensions with russia and diplomatic moves by france led to bismarck reforming the league in 1881. when the league finally lapsed in 1887, it was replaced by the reinsurance treaty, a secret agreement between germany and russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by france or austria-hungary.\\n\\nin 1890, the new german emperor, kaiser wilhelm ii, forced bismarck to retire and was persuaded not to renew the reinsurance treaty by the new chancellor, leo von caprivi. this allowed france to counteract the triple alliance with the franco-russian alliance of 1894 and the 1904 entente cordiale with britain, while in 1907 britain and russia signed the anglo-russian convention. the agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made british entry into any future conflict involving france or russia a possibility; these interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the triple entente.\\n\\narms race.the creation of the german reich following victory in the 1871 franco-prussian war led to a massive increase in germany\\'s economic and industrial strength. admiral alfred von tirpitz and wilhelm ii, who became emperor in 1890, sought to use that to create a kaiserliche marine or imperial german navy to compete with britain\\'s royal navy for world naval supremacy. in doing so, they were influenced by us naval strategist alfred mahan, who argued possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; tirpitz translated his books into german and wilhelm made them required reading. however, it was also driven by wilhelm\\'s admiration of the royal navy and desire to outdo it.\\n\\nthis resulted in the anglo-german naval arms race but the launch of in 1906 gave the royal navy a technological advantage over its german rival, which they never lost. ultimately, the race diverted huge resources to creating a german navy large enough to antagonise britain, but not defeat it. in 1911, chancellor theobald von bethmann-hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading to the rüstungswende or ‘armaments turning point\\', when germany switched expenditure from the navy to the army.\\n\\nthis was driven by russia\\'s recovery from the 1905 revolution, specifically increased investment post 1908 in railways and infrastructure in its western border regions. germany and austria-hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for fewer numbers; it was concern at the closing of this gap that led to the end of the naval race, rather than a reduction in tension elsewhere. when germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, france extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the balkan powers and italy led to increased expenditure by the ottomans and austria-hungary. absolute figures are hard to calculate, due to differences in categorising expenditure, while they often omit civilian infrastructure projects with a military use, such as railways. however, from 1908 to 1913, defence spending by the six major european powers increased by over 50% in real terms.\\n\\nconflicts in the balkans.in october 1908, austria-hungary precipitated the bosnian crisis of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former ottoman territory of bosnia and herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. this angered the kingdom of serbia and its patron, the pan-slavic and orthodox russian empire. russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the balkans, which came to be known as the \"powder keg of europe\".\\n\\nin 1912 and 1913, the first balkan war was fought between the balkan league and the fracturing ottoman empire. the resulting treaty of london further shrank the ottoman empire, creating an independent albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of bulgaria, serbia, montenegro, and greece. when bulgaria attacked serbia and greece on 16 june 1913, it sparked the 33-day second balkan war, by the end of which it lost most of macedonia to serbia and greece, and southern dobruja to romania, further destabilising the region. the great powers were able to keep these balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout europe and beyond.\\n\\nsarajevo assassination.on 28 june 1914, archduke franz ferdinand, heir presumptive to the austro-hungarian empire, visited the bosnian capital, sarajevo. a group of six assassins (cvjetko popović, gavrilo princip, muhamed mehmedbašić, nedeljko čabrinović, trifko grabež, and vaso čubrilović) from the yugoslavist group mlada bosna, supplied with arms by the serbian black hand, gathered on the street where the archduke\\'s motorcade was to pass, with the intention of assassinating him. the political objective of the assassination was to break off austria-hungary\\'s south slav provinces, which austria-hungary had annexed from the ottoman empire, so they could be combined into a yugoslavia.\\n\\nčabrinović threw a grenade at the car, but missed. some nearby were injured by the blast, but ferdinand\\'s convoy carried on. the other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them.\\n\\nabout an hour later, when ferdinand was returning from a visit at the sarajevo hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, princip stood. with a pistol, princip shot and killed ferdinand and his wife sophie. although they were reportedly not personally close, the emperor franz joseph was profoundly shocked and upset. the reaction among the people in austria, however, was mild, almost indifferent. as historian zbyněk zeman later wrote, \"the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. on sunday and monday (28 and 29 june), the crowds in vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.\" nevertheless, the political effect of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and was described by historian christopher clark on the bbc radio4 series month of madness as a \"9/11 effect, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in vienna.\"\\n\\nexpansion of violence in bosnia and herzegovina.the austro-hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent anti-serb riots in sarajevo, in which bosnian croats and bosniaks killed two bosnian serbs and damaged numerous serb-owned buildings. violent actions against ethnic serbs were also organised outside sarajevo, in other cities in austro-hungarian-controlled bosnia and herzegovina, croatia and slovenia. austro-hungarian authorities in bosnia and herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. a further 460 serbs were sentenced to death. a predominantly bosniak special militia known as the schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of serbs.\\n\\njuly crisis.the assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between austria-hungary, germany, russia, france and britain, called the july crisis. austria-hungary correctly believed that serbian officials (especially the officers of the black hand) were involved in the plot to murder the archduke, and wanted to finally end serbian interference in bosnia. on 23july, austria-hungary delivered to serbia the july ultimatum, a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with serbia. serbia decreed general mobilisation on 25july. serbia accepted all the terms of the ultimatum except for article six, which demanded that austrian delegates be allowed in serbia for the purpose of participation in the investigation into the assassination. following this, austria broke off diplomatic relations with serbia and, the next day, ordered a partial mobilisation. finally, on 28 july 1914, a month after the assassination, austria-hungary declared war on serbia.\\non 25july, russia, in support of serbia, declared partial mobilisation against austria-hungary. on 30july, russia ordered general mobilisation. german chancellor bethmann-hollweg waited until the 31st for an appropriate response, when germany declared erklärung des kriegszustandes, or \"statement on the war status\". kaiser wilhelm ii asked his cousin, tsar nicolas ii, to suspend the russian general mobilisation. when he refused, germany issued an ultimatum demanding its mobilisation be stopped, and a commitment not to support serbia. another was sent to france, asking her not to support russia if it were to come to the defence of serbia. on 1august, after the russian response, germany mobilised and declared war on russia. this also led to the general mobilisation in austria-hungary on 4august.\\n\\nthe german government issued demands to france that it remain neutral as they had to decide which deployment plan to implement, it being extremely difficult to change the deployment whilst it was underway. the modified german schlieffen plan, aufmarsch ii west, would deploy 80% of the army in the west, while aufmarsch i ost and aufmarsch ii ost would deploy 60% in the west and 40% in the east. the french did not respond, but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw 10 km from the border to avoid any incidents, and at the same time ordered the mobilisation of their reserves. germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing aufmarsch ii west.\\n\\non 1 august, wilhelm ordered general helmuth von moltke the younger to \"march the whole of the... army to the east\" after being wrongly informed that the british would remain neutral if france was not attacked. moltke told the kaiser that attempting to redeploy a million men was unthinkable, and that making it possible for the french to attack the germans \"in the rear\" would prove disastrous. yet wilhelm insisted that the german army should not march into luxembourg until he received a telegram sent by his cousin george v, who made it clear that there had been a misunderstanding. eventually the kaiser told moltke, \"now you can do what you want.\"\\n\\non 2 august, germany occupied luxembourg, and on 3august declared war on france; on the same day, they sent the belgian government an ultimatum demanding unimpeded right of way through any part of belgium, which was refused. early on the morning of 4august, the germans invaded; king albert ordered his military to resist and called for assistance under the 1839 treaty of london. britain demanded germany comply with the treaty and respect belgian neutrality; it declared war on germany at 19:00\\xa0utc on 4august 1914 (effective from 23:00), following an \"unsatisfactory reply\".\\n\\nconfusion among the central powers.the strategy of the central powers suffered from miscommunication. germany had promised to support austria-hungary\\'s invasion of serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises. austro-hungarian leaders believed germany would cover its northern flank against russia. germany, however, envisioned austria-hungary directing most of its troops against russia, while germany dealt with france. this confusion forced the austro-hungarian army to divide its forces between the russian and serbian fronts.\\n\\nserbian campaign.austria invaded and fought the serbian army at the battle of cer and battle of kolubara beginning on 12 august. over the next two weeks, austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major allied victories of the war and dashed austro-hungarian hopes of a swift victory. as a result, austria had to keep sizeable forces on the serbian front, weakening its efforts against russia. serbia\\'s defeat of the austro-hungarian invasion of 1914 has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century. the campaign saw the very first use of medical evacuation by the serbian army in autumn of 1915 and anti-aircraft warfare in the spring of 1915 after an austrian plane was shot down with ground-to-air fire.\\n\\ngerman offensive in belgium and france.when the war began, the german order of battle placed 80% of the army in the west, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the east. the plan was to quickly knock france out of the war, then redeploy to the east and do the same to russia.\\n\\nthe german offensive in the west was officially titled aufmarsch ii west, but is better known as the schlieffen plan, after its original creator. schlieffen deliberately kept the german left (i.e. its positions in alsace-lorraine) weak to lure the french into attacking there, while the majority were allocated to the german right, so as to sweep through belgium, encircle paris and trap the french armies against the swiss border (the french charged into alsace-lorraine on the outbreak of war as envisaged by their plan xvii, thus actually aiding this strategy). however, schlieffen\\'s successor moltke grew concerned that the french might push too hard on his left flank. as such, as the german army increased in size in the years leading up to the war, he changed the allocation of forces between the german right and left wings from 85:15 to 70:30. ultimately, moltke\\'s changes meant insufficient forces to achieve decisive success and thus unrealistic goals and timings.\\n\\nthe initial german advance in the west was very successful: by the end of august the allied left, which included the british expeditionary force (bef), was in full retreat; french casualties in the first month exceeded 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 august during the battle of the frontiers. german planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914, von kluck used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the german armies as they closed on paris. the french and british exploited this gap to halt the german advance east of paris at the first battle of the marne from 5to 12 september and push the german forces back some 50 km.\\n\\nin 1911, the russian stavka had agreed with the french to attack germany within 15 days of mobilisation; this was unrealistic and the two russian armies that entered east prussia on 17 august did so without many of their support elements. the russian second army was effectively destroyed at the battle of tannenberg on 26–30 august but the russian advance caused the germans to re-route their 8th field army from france to east prussia, a factor in allied victory on the marne.\\n\\nby the end of 1914, german troops held strong defensive positions inside france, controlled the bulk of france\\'s domestic coalfields and had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. however, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war. this amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the marne, crown prince wilhelm told an american reporter; \"we have lost the war. it will go on for a long time but lost it is already.\"\\n\\nasia and the pacific.new zealand occupied german samoa (later western samoa) on 30 august 1914. on 11 september, the australian naval and military expeditionary force landed on the island of neu pommern (later new britain), which formed part of german new guinea. on 28 october, the german cruiser sank the russian cruiser zhemchug in the battle of penang. japan seized germany\\'s micronesian colonies and, after the siege of tsingtao, the german coaling port of qingdao on the chinese shandong peninsula. as vienna refused to withdraw the austro-hungarian cruiser from tsingtao, japan declared war not only on germany, but also on austria-hungary; the ship participated in the defence of tsingtao where it was sunk in november 1914. within a few months, the allied forces had seized all the german territories in the pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in new guinea remained.\\n\\nafrican campaigns.some of the first clashes of the war involved british, french, and german colonial forces in africa. on 6–7 august, french and british troops invaded the german protectorate of togoland and kamerun. on 10 august, german forces in south-west africa attacked south africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. the german colonial forces in german east africa, led by colonel paul von lettow-vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during world wari and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in europe.\\n\\nindian support for the allies.germany attempted to use indian nationalism and pan-islamism to its advantage, instigating uprisings in india, and sending a mission that urged afghanistan to join the war on the side of central powers. however, contrary to british fears of a revolt in india, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards britain. indian political leaders from the indian national congress and other groups were eager to support the british war effort, since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of indian home rule. the indian army in fact outnumbered the british army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3\\xa0million indian soldiers and labourers served in europe, africa, and the middle east, while the central government and the princely states sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. in all, 140,000\\xa0men served on the western front and nearly 700,000 in the middle east. casualties of indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during world wari.\\nthe suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the british government to grant self-government to india after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and fuelled the campaign for full independence that would be led by mohandas k. gandhi and others.\\n\\ntrench warfare begins.military tactics developed before world war i failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. these advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult. commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. in time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.\\n\\nafter the first battle of the marne (5–12 september 1914), allied and german forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the \"race to the sea\". by the end of 1914, the opposing forces were left confronting each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from alsace to belgium\\'s north sea coast. since the germans were able to choose where to stand, they normally had the advantage of the high ground; in addition, their trenches tended to be better built, since anglo-french trenches were initially intended as \"temporary,\" preparatory to breaking the german defences.\\n\\nboth sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. on 22 april 1915, at the second battle of ypres, the germans (violating the hague convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front. several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. tanks were developed by britain and france and were first used in combat by the british during the battle of flers–courcelette (part of the battle of the somme) on 15 september 1916, with only partial success. however, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the germans employed only a few of their own design, supplemented by captured allied tanks.\\n\\ncontinuation of trench warfare.neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. throughout 1915–17, the british empire and france suffered more casualties than germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. strategically, while the germans mounted only one major offensive, the allies made several attempts to break through the german lines.\\n\\nin february 1916 the germans attacked french defensive positions at the battle of verdun, lasting until december 1916. the germans made initial gains, before french counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. casualties were greater for the french, but the germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. verdun became a symbol of french determination and self-sacrifice.\\n\\nthe battle of the somme was an anglo-french offensive of july to november 1916. the opening day of the offensive (1 july 1916) was the bloodiest day in the history of the british army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. the entire somme offensive cost the british army some 420,000 casualties. the french suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the germans an estimated 500,000. gun fire was not the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. the living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties (body lice) and the \\'spanish flu\\'.\\n\\nto maintain morale, wartime censors minimised early reports of widespread influenza illness and mortality in germany, the united kingdom, france, and the united states. papers were free to report the epidemic\\'s effects in neutral spain (such as the grave illness of king alfonso xiii). this created a false impression of spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic\\'s nickname, \"spanish flu\".\\n\\nprotracted action at verdun throughout 1916, combined with the bloodletting at the somme, brought the exhausted french army to the brink of collapse. futile attempts using frontal assault came at a high price for both the british and the french and led to the widespread french army mutinies, after the failure of the costly nivelle offensive of april–may 1917. the concurrent british battle of arras was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value. a smaller part of the arras offensive, the capture of vimy ridge by the canadian corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that canada\\'s national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of canada.\\n\\nthe last large-scale offensive of this period was a british attack (with french support) at passchendaele (july–november 1917). this offensive opened with great promise for the allies, before bogging down in the october mud. casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.\\n\\nthe years of trench warfare on the western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. however, throughout this period, british, french, and german tactics constantly evolved to meet new battlefield challenges.\\n\\nnaval war.at the start of the war, the german empire had cruisers scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping. the british royal navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect allied shipping. before the beginning of the war, it was widely understood that britain held the position of strongest, most influential navy in the world. the publishing of the book the influence of sea power upon history by alfred thayer mahan in 1890 was intended to encourage the united states to increase their naval power. instead, this book made it to germany and inspired its readers to try to over-power the british royal navy. for example, the german detached light cruiser , part of the east asia squadron stationed at qingdao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a russian cruiser and a french destroyer. however, most of the german east-asia squadron—consisting of the armoured cruisers and , light cruisers and and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to germany when it met british warships. the german flotilla and sank two armoured cruisers at the battle of coronel, but was virtually destroyed at the battle of the falkland islands in december 1914, with only dresden and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the battle of más a tierra these too had been destroyed or interned.\\n\\nsoon after the outbreak of hostilities, britain began a naval blockade of germany. the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries. britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships. since there was limited response to this tactic of the british, germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.\\n\\nthe battle of jutland (german: skagerrakschlacht, or \"battle of the skagerrak\") in may/june 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war. it was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. the kaiserliche marine\\'s high seas fleet, commanded by vice admiral reinhard scheer, fought the royal navy\\'s grand fleet, led by admiral sir john jellicoe. the engagement was a stand off, as the germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger british fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the british fleet than they received. strategically, however, the british asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the german surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.\\n\\ngerman u-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain. the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival. the united states launched a protest, and germany changed its rules of engagement. after the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in 1915, germany promised not to target passenger liners, while britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the \"cruiser rules\", which demanded warning and movement of crews to \"a place of safety\" (a standard that lifeboats did not meet). finally, in early 1917, germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising the americans would eventually enter the war. germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the united states could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.\\n\\nthe u-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers. this tactic made it difficult for u-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. the solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the north atlantic in convoys. the u-boats had sunk more than 5,000 allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.\\n\\nworld war i also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july 1918, as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.\\n\\nwar in the balkans.faced with russia in the east, austria-hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack serbia. after suffering heavy losses, the austrians briefly occupied the serbian capital, belgrade. a serbian counter-attack in the battle of kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. for the first ten months of 1915, austria-hungary used most of its military reserves to fight italy. german and austro-hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading bulgaria to join the attack on serbia. the austro-hungarian provinces of slovenia, croatia and bosnia provided troops for austria-hungary in the fight with serbia, russia and italy. montenegro allied itself with serbia.\\n\\nbulgaria declared war on serbia on 12 october 1915 and joined in the attack by the austro-hungarian army under mackensen\\'s army of 250,000 that was already underway. serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the central powers, now including bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops total. the serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern albania. the serbs suffered defeat in the battle of kosovo. montenegro covered the serbian retreat towards the adriatic coast in the battle of mojkovac in 6–7 january 1916, but ultimately the austrians also conquered montenegro. the surviving serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to greece. after conquest, serbia was divided between austro-hungary and bulgaria.\\n\\nin late 1915, a franco-british force landed at salonica in greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the central powers. however, the pro-german king constantine i dismissed the pro-allied government of eleftherios venizelos before the allied expeditionary force arrived. the friction between the king of greece and the allies continued to accumulate with the national schism, which effectively divided greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of venizelos in salonica. after intense negotiations and an armed confrontation in athens between allied and royalist forces (an incident known as noemvriana), the king of greece resigned and his second son alexander took his place; greece officially joined the war on the side of the allies in june 1917.\\n\\nthe macedonian front was initially mostly static. french and serbian forces retook limited areas of macedonia by recapturing bitola on 19 november 1916 following the costly monastir offensive, which brought stabilisation of the front.\\n\\nserbian and french troops finally made a breakthrough in september 1918 in the vardar offensive, after most of the german and austro-hungarian troops had been withdrawn. the bulgarians were defeated at the battle of dobro pole, and by 25 september british and french troops had crossed the border into bulgaria proper as the bulgarian army collapsed. bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 september 1918. the german high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.\\n\\nthe disappearance of the macedonian front meant that the road to budapest and vienna was now opened to allied forces. hindenburg and ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the central powers and, a day after the bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.\\n\\nottoman empire.the ottomans threatened russia\\'s caucasian territories and britain\\'s communications with india via the suez canal. as the conflict progressed, the ottoman empire took advantage of the european powers\\' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous armenian, greek, and assyrian christian populations, known as the armenian genocide, greek genocide, and assyrian genocide.\\n\\nthe british and french opened overseas fronts with the gallipoli (1915) and mesopotamian campaigns (1914). in gallipoli, the ottoman empire successfully repelled the british, french, and australian and new zealand army corps (anzacs). in mesopotamia, by contrast, after the defeat of the british defenders in the siege of kut by the ottomans (1915–16), british imperial forces reorganised and captured baghdad in march 1917. the british were aided in mesopotamia by local arab and assyrian tribesmen, while the ottomans employed local kurdish and turcoman tribes.\\n\\nfurther to the west, the suez canal was defended from ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in august, a german and ottoman force was defeated at the battle of romani by the anzac mounted division and the 52nd (lowland) infantry division. following this victory, an egyptian expeditionary force advanced across the sinai peninsula, pushing ottoman forces back in the battle of magdhaba in december and the battle of rafa on the border between the egyptian sinai and ottoman palestine in january 1917.\\n\\nrussian armies generally had success in the caucasus. enver pasha, supreme commander of the ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central asia and areas that had been lost to russia previously. he was, however, a poor commander. he launched an offensive against the russians in the caucasus in december 1914 with 100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous russian positions in winter. he lost 86% of his force at the battle of sarikamish.\\n\\nthe ottoman empire, with german support, invaded persia (modern iran) in december 1914 in an effort to cut off british and russian access to petroleum reservoirs around baku near the caspian sea. persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of british and russian influence. the ottomans and germans were aided by kurdish and azeri forces, together with a large number of major iranian tribes, such as the qashqai, tangistanis, luristanis, and khamseh, while the russians and british had the support of armenian and assyrian forces. the persian campaign was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the ottomans and their allies. however, the russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to armenian and assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards british lines in northern mesopotamia.\\n\\ngeneral yudenich, the russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the turks out of most of the southern caucasus with a string of victories. in 1917, russian grand duke nicholas assumed command of the caucasus front. nicholas planned a railway from russian georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. however, in march 1917 (february in the pre-revolutionary russian calendar), the tsar abdicated in the course of the february revolution, and the russian caucasus army began to fall apart.\\n\\nthe arab revolt, instigated by the arab bureau of the british foreign office, started june 1916 with the battle of mecca, led by sherif hussein of mecca, and ended with the ottoman surrender of damascus. fakhri pasha, the ottoman commander of medina, resisted for more than two and half years during the siege of medina before surrendering in january 1919.\\n\\nthe senussi tribe, along the border of italian libya and british egypt, incited and armed by the turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against allied troops. the british were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the senussi campaign. their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.\\n\\ntotal allied casualties on the ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men. total ottoman casualties were 725,000 (325,000 dead and 400,000 wounded).\\n\\nitalian participation.italy had been allied with the german and austro-hungarian empires since 1882 as part of the triple alliance. however, the nation had its own designs on austrian territory in trentino, the austrian littoral, fiume (rijeka) and dalmatia. rome had a secret 1902 pact with france, effectively nullifying its part in the triple alliance; italy secretly agreed with france to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by germany. at the start of hostilities, italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the triple alliance was defensive and that austria-hungary was an aggressor. the austro-hungarian government began negotiations to secure italian neutrality, offering the french colony of tunisia in return. the allies made a counter-offer in which italy would receive the southern tyrol, austrian littoral and territory on the dalmatian coast after the defeat of austria-hungary. this was formalised by the treaty of london. further encouraged by the allied invasion of turkey in april 1915, italy joined the triple entente and declared war on austria-hungary on 23 may. fifteen months later, italy declared war on germany.\\n\\nthe italians had numerical superiority, but this advantage was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which the fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. field marshal luigi cadorna, a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the slovenian plateau, taking ljubljana and threatening vienna.\\n\\non the trentino front, the austro-hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. after an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while austrian kaiserschützen and standschützen engaged italian alpini in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. the austro-hungarians counterattacked in the altopiano of asiago, towards verona and padua, in the spring of 1916 (strafexpedition), but made little progress and were defeated by the italians.\\n\\nbeginning in 1915, the italians under cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the isonzo front along the isonzo (soča) river, northeast of trieste. of these eleven offensives, five were won by italy, three remained inconclusive, and the other three were repelled by the austro-hungarians, who held the higher ground. in the summer of 1916, after the battle of doberdò, the italians captured the town of gorizia. after this victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several italian offensives, centred on the banjšice and karst plateau east of gorizia.\\n\\nthe central powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 october 1917, spearheaded by the germans, and achieved a victory at caporetto (kobarid). the italian army was routed and retreated more than 100 km to reorganise. the new italian chief of staff, armando diaz, ordered the army to stop their retreat and defend the monte grappa summit, where fortified defenses were constructed; the italians repelled the austro-hungarian and german army, and stabilised the front at the piave river. since the italian army had suffered heavy losses in the battle of caporetto, the italian government ordered conscription of the so-called 99 boys (ragazzi del \\'99): all males born in 1899 and prior, who were 18 years old or older. in 1918, the austro-hungarians failed to break through in a series of battles on the piave and were finally decisively defeated in the battle of vittorio veneto in october. on 1november, the italian navy destroyed much of the austro-hungarian fleet stationed in pula, preventing it from being handed over to the new state of slovenes, croats and serbs. on 3november, the italians invaded trieste from the sea. on the same day, the armistice of villa giusti was signed. by mid-november 1918, the italian military occupied the entire former austrian littoral and had seized control of the portion of dalmatia that had been guaranteed to italy by the london pact. by the end of hostilities in november 1918, admiral enrico millo declared himself italy\\'s governor of dalmatia. austria-hungary surrendered on 11 november 1918.\\n\\nromanian participation.romania had been allied with the central powers since 1882. when the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because austria-hungary had itself declared war on serbia, romania was under no obligation to join the war. on 4august 1916, romania and the entente signed the political treaty and military convention, that established the coordinates of romania\\'s participation in the war. in return, it received the allies\\' formal sanction for transylvania, banat and other territories of austria-hungary to be annexed to romania. the action had large popular support. on 27 august 1916, the romanian army launched an attack against austria-hungary, with limited russian support. the romanian offensive was initially successful in transylvania, but a central powers counterattack by the drove them back. as a result of the battle of bucharest, the central powers occupied bucharest on 6december 1916. fighting in moldova continued in 1917, but russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the october revolution meant that romania was forced to sign an armistice with the central powers on 9december 1917.\\n\\nin january 1918, romanian forces established control over bessarabia as the russian army abandoned the province. although a treaty was signed by the romanian and bolshevik russian governments following talks between 5and 9march 1918 on the withdrawal of romanian forces from bessarabia within two months, on 27 march 1918 romania formally attached bessarabia, inhabited by a romanian majority, to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with romania.\\n\\nromania officially made peace with the central powers by signing the treaty of bucharest on 7may 1918. under the treaty, romania was obliged to end the war with the central powers and make small territorial concessions to austria-hungary, ceding control of some passes in the carpathian mountains, and to grant oil concessions to germany. in exchange, the central powers recognised the sovereignty of romania over bessarabia. the treaty was renounced in october 1918 by the alexandru marghiloman government, and romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 november 1918 against the central powers. the next day, the treaty of bucharest was nullified by the terms of the armistice of compiègne. total romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.\\n\\ninitial actions.russian plans for the start of the war called for simultaneous invasions of austrian galicia and east prussia. although russia\\'s initial advance into galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from east prussia by hindenburg and ludendorff at the battles of tannenberg and the masurian lakes in august and september 1914. russia\\'s less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership were instrumental in the events that unfolded. by the spring of 1915, the russians had retreated to galicia, and, in may, the central powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on poland\\'s southern frontiers with their gorlice–tarnów offensive. on 5august, they captured warsaw and forced the russians to withdraw from poland.\\n\\nrussian revolution.despite russia\\'s success in the june 1916 brusilov offensive against the austrians in eastern galicia, the offensive was undermined by the reluctance of other russian generals to commit their forces to support the victory. allied and russian forces were revived only briefly by romania\\'s entry into the war on 27 august, as romania was rapidly defeated by a central powers offensive. meanwhile, unrest grew in russia as the tsar remained at the front. the increasingly incompetent rule of empress alexandra drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, rasputin, at the end of 1916.\\nin march 1917, demonstrations in petrograd culminated in the abdication of tsar nicholas ii and the appointment of a weak provisional government, which shared power with the petrograd soviet socialists. this arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. the army became increasingly ineffective.\\n\\nfollowing the tsar\\'s abdication, vladimir lenin—with the help of the german government—was ushered by train from switzerland into russia 16 april 1917. discontent and the weaknesses of the provisional government led to a rise in the popularity of the bolshevik party, led by lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. the revolution of november was followed in december by an armistice and negotiations with germany. at first, the bolsheviks refused the german terms, but when german troops began marching across ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the treaty of brest-litovsk on 3march 1918. the treaty ceded vast territories, including finland, the baltic provinces, parts of poland and ukraine to the central powers. despite this enormous german success, the manpower required by the germans to occupy the captured territory may have contributed to the failure of their spring offensive, and secured relatively little food or other materiel for the central powers war effort.\\n\\nwith the adoption of the treaty of brest-litovsk, the entente no longer existed. the allied powers led a small-scale invasion of russia, partly to stop germany from exploiting russian resources, and to a lesser extent, to support the \"whites\" (as opposed to the \"reds\") in the russian civil war. allied troops landed in arkhangelsk and in vladivostok as part of the north russia intervention.\\n\\nczechoslovak legion.the czechoslovak legion fought on the side of the entente. its goal was to win support for the independence of czechoslovakia. the legion in russia was established in september 1914, in december 1917 in france (including volunteers from america) and in april 1918 in italy. czechoslovak legion troops defeated the austro-hungarian army at the ukrainian village of zborov, in july 1917. after this success, the number of czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as czechoslovak military power. in the battle of bakhmach, the legion defeated the germans and forced them to make a truce.\\n\\nin russia, they were heavily involved in the russian civil war, siding with the whites against the bolsheviks, at times controlling most of the trans-siberian railway and conquering all the major cities of siberia. the presence of the czechoslovak legion near yekaterinburg appears to have been one of the motivations for the bolshevik execution of the tsar and his family in july 1918. legionaries arrived less than a week afterwards and captured the city. because russia\\'s european ports were not safe, the corps was evacuated by a long detour via the port of vladivostok. the last transport was the american ship heffron in september 1920.\\n\\ncentral powers peace overtures.on 12 december 1916, after ten brutal months of the battle of verdun and a successful offensive against romania, germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the allies. however, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a \"duplicitous war ruse\".\\n\\nsoon after, the us president, woodrow wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. lloyd george\\'s war cabinet considered the german offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the allies. after initial outrage and much deliberation, they took wilson\\'s note as a separate effort, signalling that the united states was on the verge of entering the war against germany following the \"submarine outrages\". while the allies debated a response to wilson\\'s offer, the germans chose to rebuff it in favour of \"a direct exchange of views\". learning of the german response, the allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 january. they sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for france, russia and romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. this included the liberation of italians, slavs, romanians, czecho-slovaks, and the creation of a \"free and united poland\". on the question of security, the allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement. the negotiations failed and the entente powers rejected the german offer on the grounds that germany had not put forward any specific proposals.\\n\\n1917–1918.events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.\\n\\ndevelopments in 1917.the british naval blockade began to have a serious impact on germany. in response, in february 1917, the german general staff convinced chancellor theobald von bethmann-hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving britain out of the war. german planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. the general staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the united states into the conflict, but calculated that british shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before american intervention could have an effect. tonnage sunk rose above 500,000\\xa0tons per month from february to july. it peaked at 860,000\\xa0tons in april. after july, the newly re-introduced convoy system became effective in reducing the u-boat threat. britain was safe from starvation, while german industrial output fell, and the united states joined the war far earlier than germany had anticipated.\\n\\non 3 may 1917, during the nivelle offensive, the french 2nd colonial division, veterans of the battle of verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. the french army mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 french divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. however, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the french soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action. robert nivelle was removed from command by 15 may, replaced by general philippe pétain, who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.\\n\\nthe victory of the central powers at the battle of caporetto led the allies to convene the rapallo conference at which they formed the supreme war council to co-ordinate planning. previously, british and french armies had operated under separate commands.\\n\\nin december, the central powers signed an armistice with russia, thus freeing large numbers of german troops for use in the west. with german reinforcements and new american troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the western front. the central powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in europe. thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.\\n\\nin 1917, emperor charles i of austria secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with clemenceau, through his wife\\'s brother sixtus in belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of germany. italy opposed the proposals. when the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.\\n\\nottoman empire conflict, 1917–1918.in march and april 1917, at the first and second battles of gaza, german and ottoman forces stopped the advance of the egyptian expeditionary force, which had begun in august 1916 at the battle of romani.\\nat the end of october, the sinai and palestine campaign resumed, when general edmund allenby\\'s xxth corps, xxi corps and desert mounted corps won the battle of beersheba. two ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the battle of mughar ridge and, early in december, jerusalem was captured following another ottoman defeat at the battle of jerusalem. about this time, friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the eighth army\\'s commander, replaced by djevad pasha, and a few months later the commander of the ottoman army in palestine, erich von falkenhayn, was replaced by otto liman von sanders.\\n\\nin early 1918, the front line was extended and the jordan valley was occupied, following the first transjordan and the second transjordan attacks by british empire forces in march and april 1918. in march, most of the egyptian expeditionary force\\'s british infantry and yeomanry cavalry were sent to the western front as a consequence of the spring offensive. they were replaced by indian army units. during several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a number of attacks were carried out on sections of the ottoman front line. these pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived indian army infantry. it was not until the middle of september that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.\\n\\nthe reorganised egyptian expeditionary force, with an additional mounted division, broke ottoman forces at the battle of megiddo in september 1918. in two days the british and indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the eighth army (ottoman empire) at tulkarm, the continuous trench lines at tabsor, arara, and the seventh army (ottoman empire) headquarters at nablus. the desert mounted corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry. during virtually continuous operations by australian light horse, british mounted yeomanry, indian lancers, and new zealand mounted rifle brigades in the jezreel valley, they captured nazareth, afulah and beisan, jenin, along with haifa on the mediterranean coast and daraa east of the jordan river on the hejaz railway. samakh and tiberias on the sea of galilee were captured on the way northwards to damascus. meanwhile, chaytor\\'s force of australian light horse, new zealand mounted rifles, indian, british west indies and jewish infantry captured the crossings of the jordan river, es salt, amman and at ziza most of the fourth army (ottoman empire). the armistice of mudros, signed at the end of october, ended hostilities with the ottoman empire when fighting was continuing north of aleppo.\\n\\n15 august 1917: peace offer by the pope.on or shortly before 15 august 1917 pope benedict xv made a peace proposal suggesting:\\n- no annexations\\n- no indemnities, except to compensate for severe war damage in belgium and parts of france and of serbia\\n- a solution to the problems of alsace-lorraine, trentino and trieste\\n- restoration of the kingdom of poland\\n- germany to pull out of belgium and france\\n- germany\\'s overseas colonies to be returned to germany\\n- general disarmament\\n- a supreme court of arbitration to settle future disputes between nations\\n- the freedom of the seas\\n- abolish all retaliatory economic conflicts\\n- no point in ordering reparations, because so much damage had been caused to all belligerents\\n\\nentry of the united states.at the outbreak of the war, the united states pursued a policy of non-intervention, avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. when the german u-boat u-20 sank the british liner rms lusitania on 7may 1915 with 128 americans among the dead, president woodrow wilson insisted that america is \"too proud to fight\" but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. germany complied. wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. however, he also repeatedly warned that the united states would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. former president theodore roosevelt denounced german acts as \"piracy\". wilson was narrowly re-elected in 1916 after campaigning with the slogan \"he kept us out of war\".\\n\\nin january 1917, germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, in the hopes of starving britain into surrender. germany did this realising it would mean american entry. the german foreign minister, in the zimmermann telegram, invited mexico to join the war as germany\\'s ally against the united states. in return, the germans would finance mexico\\'s war and help it recover the territories of texas, new mexico, and arizona. the united kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the us embassy in the uk. from there it made its way to president wilson who released the zimmermann note to the public, and americans saw it as casus belli. wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. he argued that the war was so important that the us had to have a voice in the peace conference. after the sinking of seven us merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the zimmermann telegram, wilson called for war on germany on 2april 1917, which the us congress declared 4days later.\\n\\nthe united states was never formally a member of the allies but became a self-styled \"associated power\". the united states had a small army, but, after the passage of the selective service act, it drafted 2.8\\xa0million men, and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to france every day. in 1917, the us congress granted us citizenship to puerto ricans to allow them to be drafted to participate in world wari, as part of the jones–shafroth act. german general staff assumptions that it would be able to defeat the british and french forces before american troops reinforced them were proven incorrect.\\n\\nthe united states navy sent a battleship group to scapa flow to join with the british grand fleet, destroyers to queenstown, ireland, and submarines to help guard convoys. several regiments of us marines were also dispatched to france. the british and french wanted american units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. general john j. pershing, american expeditionary forces (aef) commander, refused to break up american units to be used as filler material. as an exception, he did allow african-american combat regiments to be used in french divisions. the harlem hellfighters fought as part of the french 16th division, and earned a unit croix de guerre for their actions at château-thierry, belleau wood, and sechault. aef doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by british empire and french commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.\\n\\ngerman spring offensive of 1918.ludendorff drew up plans (codenamed operation michael) for the 1918 offensive on the western front. the spring offensive sought to divide the british and french forces with a series of feints and advances. the german leadership hoped to end the war before significant us forces arrived. the operation commenced on 21 march 1918 with an attack on british forces near saint-quentin. german forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 km.\\n\\nbritish and french trenches were penetrated using novel infiltration tactics, also named hutier tactics after general oskar von hutier, by specially trained units called stormtroopers. previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. in the spring offensive of 1918, however, ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. they attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. more heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. this german success relied greatly on the element of surprise.\\n\\nthe front moved to within 120 km of paris. three heavy krupp railway guns fired 183\\xa0shells on the capital, causing many parisians to flee. the initial offensive was so successful that kaiser wilhelm ii declared 24 march a national holiday. many germans thought victory was near. after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the germans were unable to consolidate their gains. the problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.\\n\\ngeneral foch pressed to use the arriving american troops as individual replacements, whereas pershing sought to field american units as an independent force. these units were assigned to the depleted french and british empire commands on 28 march. a supreme war council of allied forces was created at the doullens conference on 5november 1917. general foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. haig, petain, and pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the british, french, and us commands operated largely independently.\\n\\nfollowing operation michael, germany launched operation georgette against the northern english channel ports. the allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by germany. the german army to the south then conducted operations blücher and yorck, pushing broadly towards paris. germany launched operation marne (second battle of the marne) on 15 july, in an attempt to encircle reims. the resulting counter-attack, which started the hundred days offensive, marked the first successful allied offensive of the war. by 20 july, the germans had retreated across the marne to their starting lines, having achieved little, and the german army never regained the initiative. german casualties between march and april 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.\\n\\nmeanwhile, germany was falling apart at home. anti-war marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. industrial output was half the 1913 levels.\\n\\nnew states enter the war.in the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the south caucasus: the first republic of armenia, the azerbaijan democratic republic, and the democratic republic of georgia, which declared their independence from the russian empire. two other minor entities were established, the centrocaspian dictatorship and south west caucasian republic (the former was liquidated by azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint armenian-british task force in early 1919). with the withdrawal of the russian armies from the caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. solidarity was briefly maintained when the transcaucasian federative republic was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in may, when the georgians asked for and received protection from germany and the azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the ottoman empire that was more akin to a military alliance. armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the ottoman turks before defeating them at the battle of sardarabad.\\n\\nhundred days offensive.the allied counteroffensive, known as the hundred days offensive, began on 8august 1918, with the battle of amiens. the battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 british, dominion, and french troops, and by the end of its first day a gap 24 km long had been created in the german lines. the defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing ludendorff to refer to this day as the \"black day of the german army\". after an advance as far as 23 km, german resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 august.\\n\\nrather than continuing the amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the allies shifted attention elsewhere. allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. they began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.\\n\\nthe day after the offensive began, ludendorff said: \"we cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.\" on 11 august he offered his resignation to the kaiser, who refused it, replying, \"i see that we must strike a balance. we have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. the war must be ended.\" on 13 august, at spa, hindenburg, ludendorff, the chancellor, and foreign minister hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the german crown council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. austria and hungary warned that they could continue the war only until december, and ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. prince rupprecht warned prince max of baden: \"our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that i no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier.\"\\n\\nbattle of albert.british and dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the battle of albert on 21 august. the assault was widened by french and then further british forces in the following days. during the last week of august the allied pressure along a 110 km front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. from german accounts, \"each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines.\"\\n\\nfaced with these advances, on 2 september the german supreme army command issued orders to withdraw in the south to the hindenburg line. this ceded without a fight the salient seized the previous april. according to ludendorff, \"we had to admit the necessity\\xa0... to withdraw the entire front from the scarpe to the vesle. in nearly four weeks of fighting beginning on 8august, over 100,000 german prisoners were taken. the german high command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. on 10 september hindenburg urged peace moves to emperor charles of austria, and germany appealed to the netherlands for mediation. on 14 september austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 september germany made a peace offer to belgium. both peace offers were rejected.\\n\\nallied advance to the hindenburg line.in september the allies advanced to the hindenburg line in the north and centre. the germans continued to fight strong rear-guard actions and launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the line continued to fall, with the bef alone taking 30,441\\xa0prisoners in the last week of september. on 24 september an assault by both the british and french came within 3 km of st. quentin. the germans had now retreated to positions along or behind the hindenburg line. that same day, supreme army command informed the leaders in berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.\\n\\nthe final assault on the hindenburg line began with the meuse-argonne offensive, launched by french and american troops on 26 september. the following week, co-operating french and american units broke through in champagne at the battle of blanc mont ridge, forcing the germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the belgian frontier. on 8october the line was pierced again by british and dominion troops at the battle of cambrai. the german army had to shorten its front and use the dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions as it fell back towards germany.\\n\\nwhen bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 september, ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. it was evident that germany could no longer mount a successful defence. the collapse of the balkans meant that germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. its reserves had been used up, even as us troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day. the americans supplied more than 80% of allied oil during the war, and there was no shortage.\\n\\ngerman revolution 1918–1919.news of germany\\'s impending military defeat spread throughout the german armed forces. the threat of mutiny was rife. admiral reinhard scheer and ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the \"valour\" of the german navy.\\n\\nin northern germany, the german revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of october 1918. units of the german navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. the sailors\\' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of wilhelmshaven and kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9november 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii, and to german surrender.\\n\\nnew german government surrenders.with the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, germany moved towards surrender. prince maximilian of baden took charge of a new government on 3october as chancellor of germany to negotiate with the allies. negotiations with president wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the british and french. wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the german military. there was no resistance when the social democrat philipp scheidemann on 9november declared germany to be a republic. the kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and wilhelm fled to exile in the netherlands. imperial germany was dead; a new germany had been born as the weimar republic.\\n\\narmistices and capitulations.the collapse of the central powers came swiftly. bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918. german emperor wilhelm ii in his telegram to bulgarian tsar ferdinand i described situation: “disgraceful! 62,000 serbs decided the war!\". on 29 september 1918, the german supreme army command informed kaiser wilhelm ii and the imperial chancellor count georg von hertling, that the military situation facing germany was hopeless .\\n\\non 30 october, the ottoman empire capitulated, signing the armistice of mudros.\\n\\non 24 october, the italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the battle of caporetto. this culminated in the battle of vittorio veneto, which marked the end of the austro-hungarian army as an effective fighting force. the offensive also triggered the disintegration of the austro-hungarian empire. during the last week of october, declarations of independence were made in budapest, prague, and zagreb. on 29 october, the imperial authorities asked italy for an armistice, but the italians continued advancing, reaching trento, udine, and trieste. on 3november, austria-hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an armistice (armistice of villa giusti). the terms, arranged by telegraph with the allied authorities in paris, were communicated to the austrian commander and accepted. the armistice with austria was signed in the villa giusti, near padua, on 3november. austria and hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the habsburg monarchy. in the following days the italian army occupied innsbruck and all tyrol with over 20,000 soldiers.\\n\\non 11 november, at 5:00 am, an armistice with germany was signed in a railroad carriage at compiègne. at 11\\xa0am on 11 november 1918—\"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\"—a ceasefire came into effect. during the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the western front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. the occupation of the rhineland took place following the armistice. the occupying armies consisted of american, belgian, british and french forces.\\n\\nin november 1918, the allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade germany. yet at the time of the armistice, no allied force had crossed the german frontier, the western front was still some 720 km from berlin, and the kaiser\\'s armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. these factors enabled hindenburg and other senior german leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. this resulted in the stab-in-the-back legend, which attributed germany\\'s defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic and unfit to fight), but to the public\\'s failure to respond to its \"patriotic calling\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by jews, socialists, and bolsheviks.\\n\\nthe allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. one estimate (using 1913 us dollars) is that the allies spent $58\\xa0billion on the war and the central powers only $25\\xa0billion. among the allies, the uk spent $21\\xa0billion and the us$17\\xa0billion; among the central powers germany spent $20\\xa0billion.\\n\\naftermath.in the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the german, austro-hungarian, ottoman, and russian. numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the romanovs, the hohenzollerns, the habsburgs, and the ottomans. belgium and serbia were badly damaged, as was france, with 1.4\\xa0million soldiers dead, not counting other casualties. germany and russia were similarly affected.\\n\\nformal end of the war.a formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the treaty of versailles with germany on 28 june 1919. the united states senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it, and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the knox–porter resolution was signed on 2july 1921 by president warren g. harding. for the united kingdom and the british empire, the state of war ceased under the provisions of the termination of the present war (definition) act 1918 with respect to:\\n\\nafter the treaty of versailles, treaties with austria, hungary, bulgaria, and the ottoman empire were signed. however, the negotiation of the treaty with the ottoman empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the allied powers and the country that would shortly become the republic of turkey was not signed until 24 july 1923, at lausanne.\\n\\nsome war memorials date the end of the war as being when the versailles treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war\\'s end concentrate on the armistice of 11 november 1918. legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the treaty of lausanne, was signed. under its terms, the allied forces left constantinople on 23 august 1923.\\n\\npeace treaties and national boundaries.after the war, the paris peace conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the central powers officially ending the war. the 1919 treaty of versailles dealt with germany and, building on wilson\\'s 14th point, brought into being the league of nations on 28 june 1919.\\n\\nthe central powers had to acknowledge responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by\" their aggression. in the treaty of versailles, this statement was article 231. this article became known as the war guilt clause as the majority of germans felt humiliated and resentful. overall the germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the \"diktat of versailles\". german historian hagen schulze said the treaty placed germany \"under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated.\" belgian historian laurence van ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the versailles treaty in german politics in the 1920s and 1930s:\\nactive denial of war guilt in germany and german resentment at both reparations and continued allied occupation of the rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. the legend of the \"stab in the back\" and the wish to revise the \"versailles diktat\", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the german nation persisted at the heart of german politics. even a man of peace such as [gustav] stresemann publicly rejected german guilt. as for the nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the german nation into a spirit of revenge. like a fascist italy, nazi germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.\\n\\nmeanwhile, new nations liberated from german rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours. the peace conference required all the defeated powers to pay reparations for all the damage done to civilians. however, owing to economic difficulties and germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on germany.\\n\\naustria-hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including austria, hungary, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. transylvania was shifted from hungary to greater romania. the details were contained in the treaty of saint-germain and the treaty of trianon. as a result of the treaty of trianon, 3.3\\xa0million hungarians came under foreign rule. although the hungarians made up approximately 54% of the population of the pre-war kingdom of hungary (according to the 1910 census), only 32% of its territory was left to hungary. between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 hungarians fled former hungarian territories attached to romania, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia.\\n\\nthe russian empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the october revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of estonia, finland, latvia, lithuania, and poland were carved from it. romania took control of bessarabia in april 1918.\\n\\nthe ottoman empire disintegrated, with much of its levant territory awarded to various allied powers as protectorates. the turkish core in anatolia was reorganised as the republic of turkey. the ottoman empire was to be partitioned by the treaty of sèvres of 1920. this treaty was never ratified by the sultan and was rejected by the turkish national movement, leading to the victorious turkish war of independence and the much less stringent 1923 treaty of lausanne.\\n\\neven though a lot of countries had already made a peace treaty, there was one exception, andorra. andorra declared war on germany in august 1914, but, because it had a very small population, andorra had never sent any soldiers to the battlefield. because of that, andorra was not allowed to go to the treaty of versailles, so the country had not made a peace treaty with germany until 1958.\\nwhen andorra made the declaration of war, it had an army of 600 part-time militarymen, commanded by two officials.\\n\\nnational identities.after 123 years, poland re-emerged as an independent country. the kingdom of serbia and its dynasty, as a \"minor entente nation\" and the country with the most casualties per capita, became the backbone of a new multinational state, the kingdom of serbs, croats and slovenes, later renamed yugoslavia. czechoslovakia, combining the kingdom of bohemia with parts of the kingdom of hungary, became a new nation. russia became the soviet union and lost finland, estonia, lithuania, and latvia, which became independent countries. the ottoman empire was soon replaced by turkey and several other countries in the middle east.\\n\\nin the british empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. in australia and new zealand the battle of gallipoli became known as those nations\\' \"baptism of fire\". it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that australian troops fought as australians, not just subjects of the british crown. anzac day, commemorating the australian and new zealand army corps (anzac), celebrates this defining moment.\\n\\nafter the battle of vimy ridge, where the canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps, canadians began to refer to their country as a nation \"forged from fire\". having succeeded on the same battleground where the \"mother countries\" had previously faltered, they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments. canada entered the war as a dominion of the british empire and remained so, although it emerged with a greater measure of independence. when britain declared war in 1914, the dominions were automatically at war; at the conclusion, canada, australia, new zealand, and south africa were individual signatories of the treaty of versailles.\\n\\nlobbying by chaim weizmann and fear that american jews would encourage the united states to support germany culminated in the british government\\'s balfour declaration of 1917, endorsing creation of a jewish homeland in palestine. a total of more than 1,172,000 jewish soldiers served in the allied and central power forces in world wari, including 275,000 in austria-hungary and 450,000 in tsarist russia.\\n\\nthe establishment of the modern state of israel and the roots of the continuing israeli–palestinian conflict are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the middle east that resulted from world wari. before the end of the war, the ottoman empire had maintained a modest level of peace and stability throughout the middle east. with the fall of the ottoman government, power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge. the political boundaries drawn by the victors of world wari were quickly imposed, sometimes after only cursory consultation with the local population. these continue to be problematic in the 21st-century struggles for national identity. while the dissolution of the ottoman empire at the end of world wari was pivotal in contributing to the modern political situation of the middle east, including the arab-israeli conflict, the end of ottoman rule also spawned lesser known disputes over water and other natural resources.\\n\\nthe prestige of germany and german things in latin america remained high after the war but did not recovered to its pre-war levels. indeed, in chile the war bought an end to a period of intense scientific and cultural influence writer eduardo de la barra scorningly called \"the german bewichment\" ().\\n\\nhealth effects.of the 60\\xa0million european military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8\\xa0million were killed, 7\\xa0million were permanently disabled, and 15\\xa0million were seriously injured. germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, austria-hungary lost 17.1%, and france lost 10.5%. in germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. by the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000\\xa0people in lebanon. between 5and 10 million people died in the russian famine of 1921. by 1922, there were between 4.5\\xa0million and 7million homeless children in russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from world wari, the russian civil war, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922. numerous anti-soviet russians fled the country after the revolution; by the 1930s, the northern chinese city of harbin had 100,000\\xa0russians. thousands more emigrated to france, england, and the united states.\\n\\nthe australian prime minister, billy hughes, wrote to the british prime minister, lloyd george, \"you have assured us that you cannot get better terms. i much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the british empire and her allies.\" australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were £831,280,947. of about 416,000 australians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.\\n\\ndiseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. in 1914 alone, louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in serbia. from 1918 to 1922, russia had about 25\\xa0million infections and 3million deaths from epidemic typhus. in 1923, 13 million russians contracted malaria, a sharp increase from the pre-war years. in addition, a major influenza epidemic spread around the world. overall, the 1918 flu pandemic killed at least 50 million people. moreover, between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world affecting nearly five million people.\\n\\nthe social disruption and widespread violence of the russian revolution of 1917 and the ensuing russian civil war sparked more than 2,000 pogroms in the former russian empire, mostly in ukraine. an estimated 60,000–200,000\\xa0civilian jews were killed in the atrocities.\\n\\nin the aftermath of world war i, greece fought against turkish nationalists led by mustafa kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the treaty of lausanne. according to various sources, several hundred thousand greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the greek genocide.\\n\\nground warfare.world war i began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. by the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and aircraft. infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior nco, were favoured.\\n\\nartillery also underwent a revolution. in 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. by 1917, indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone. counter-battery missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.\\n\\ngermany was far ahead of the allies in using heavy indirect fire. the german army employed 150 mm and 210 mm howitzers in 1914, when typical french and british guns were only 75 mm and 105 mm. the british had a 6-inch (152\\xa0mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. the germans also fielded austrian 305 mm and 420 mm guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of minenwerfer, which were ideally suited for trench warfare.\\n\\non 27 june 1917 the germans used the biggest gun in the world, batterie pommern, nicknamed \"lange max\". this gun from krupp was able to shoot 750\\xa0kg shells from koekelare to dunkirk, a distance of about 50 km.\\n\\nmuch of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during world wari. such battles include ypres, the marne, cambrai, the somme, verdun, and gallipoli. the germans employed the haber process of nitrogen fixation to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the british naval blockade. artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties and consumed vast quantities of explosives. the large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and fragmentation forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the french, who introduced the adrian helmet in 1915. it was quickly followed by the brodie helmet, worn by british imperial and us troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive german stahlhelm, a design, with improvements, still in use today.\\n\\nthe widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. gases used included chlorine, mustard gas and phosgene. relatively few war casualties were caused by gas, as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as gas masks. the use of chemical warfare and small-scale strategic bombing (as opposed to tactical bombing) were both outlawed by the hague conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness, though they captured the public imagination.\\n\\nthe most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece. the german version were nicknamed big berthas, even though the namesake was not a railway gun. germany developed the paris gun, able to bombard paris from over 100 km, though shells were relatively light at 94\\xa0kilograms (210\\xa0lb).\\n\\ntrenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation shells helped bring the battle lines of world wari to a stalemate. the british and the french sought a solution with the creation of the tank and mechanised warfare. the british first tanks were used during the battle of the somme on 15 september 1916. mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. within a year, the british were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the battle of cambrai in november 1917, by breaking the hindenburg line, while combined arms teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100\\xa0guns. meanwhile, the french introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the renault ft, which became a decisive tool of the victory. the conflict also saw the introduction of light automatic weapons and submachine guns, such as the lewis gun, the browning automatic rifle, and the bergmann mp18.\\n\\nanother new weapon, the flamethrower, was first used by the german army and later adopted by other forces. although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.\\n\\ntrench railways evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.\\n\\nareas taken in major attacks.on the western front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at verdun, the somme, passchendaele, and cambrai the exception was nivelle\\'s offensive in which the german defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the french army. in 1918 the germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: michael, on the lys, and on the aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. the allies struck back at soissons, which showed the germans that they must return to the defensive, and at amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at cambrai.\\n\\nthe areas in the east were larger. the germans did well at the first masurian lakes driving the invaders from east prussia, and at riga, which led the russians to sue for peace. the austro-hungarians and germans joined for a great success at gorlice–tarnów, which drove the russians out of poland. in a series of attacks along with the bulgarians they occupied serbia, albania, montenegro and most of romania. the allies successes came later in palestine, the beginning of the end for the ottomans, in macedonia, which drove the bulgarians out of the war, and at vittorio veneto, the final blow for the austro-hungarians. the area occupied in east by the central powers on 11 november 1918 was 1042600 km2.\\n\\nnaval.germany deployed u-boats (submarines) after the war began. alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the atlantic, the kaiserliche marine employed them to deprive the british isles of vital supplies. the deaths of british merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of u-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive sonar, 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines (hms r-1, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918). to extend their operations, the germans proposed supply submarines (1916). most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until world warii revived the need.\\n\\naviation.fixed-wing aircraft were first used militarily by the italians in libya on 23 october 1911 during the italo-turkish war for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and aerial photography the next year. by 1914, their military utility was obvious. they were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. to shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. strategic bombers were created, principally by the germans and british, though the former used zeppelins as well. towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a raid to destroy the zeppelin hangars at tondern in 1918.\\n\\nmanned observation balloons, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with parachutes, so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. at the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the british leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.\\n\\nrecognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. to defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. the germans conducted air raids on england during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage british morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from france.\\n\\nbaralong incidents.on 19 august 1915, the german submarine u-27 was sunk by the british q-ship . all german survivors were summarily executed by baralongs crew on the orders of lieutenant godfrey herbert, the captain of the ship. the shooting was reported to the media by american citizens who were on board the nicosia, a british freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by u-27 just minutes before the incident.\\n\\non 24 september, baralong destroyed u-41, which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship urbino. according to karl goetz, the submarine\\'s commander, baralong continued to fly the us flag after firing on u-41 and then rammed the lifeboat—carrying the german survivors—sinking it.\\n\\ntorpedoing of hmhs llandovery castle.the canadian hospital ship was torpedoed by the german submarine sm u-86 on 27 june 1918 in violation of international law. only 24 of the 258 medical personnel, patients, and crew survived. survivors reported that the u-boat surfaced and ran down the lifeboats, machine-gunning survivors in the water. the u-boat captain, helmut patzig, was charged with war crimes in germany following the war, but escaped prosecution by going to the free city of danzig, beyond the jurisdiction of german courts.\\n\\nblockade of germany.after the war, the german government claimed that approximately 763,000 german civilians died from starvation and disease during the war because of the allied blockade. an academic study done in 1928 put the death toll at 424,000. germany protested that the allies had used starvation as a weapon of war. sally marks argued that the german accounts of a hunger blockade are a \"myth,\" as germany did not face the starvation level of belgium and the regions of poland and northern france that it occupied. according to the british judge and legal philosopher patrick devlin, \"the war orders given by the admiralty on 26 august [1914] were clear enough. all food consigned to germany through neutral ports was to be captured and all food consigned to rotterdam was to be presumed consigned to germany.\\xa0... the british were determined on the starvation policy, whether or not it was lawful.\"\\n\\nchemical weapons in warfare.the german army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the second battle of ypres (22 april – 25 may 1915), after german scientists working under the direction of fritz haber at the kaiser wilhelm institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine. the use of chemical weapons was sanctioned by the german high command in an effort to force allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons. in time, chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately 1.3\\xa0million casualties, but relatively few fatalities: about 90,000 in total. for example, there were an estimated 186,000 british chemical weapons casualties during the war (80% of which were the result of exposure to the vesicant sulfur mustard, introduced to the battlefield by the germans in july 1917, which burns the skin at any point of contact and inflicts more severe lung damage than chlorine or phosgene), and up to one-third of american casualties were caused by them. the russian army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in world wari. the use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the 1907 hague convention on land warfare, which prohibited their use.\\n\\nthe effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. in addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. an estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. british field marshal sir douglas haig wrote in his diary, \"my officers and i were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. however, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all.\"\\n\\nthe war damaged chemistry\\'s prestige in european societies, in particular the german variety.\\n\\nottoman empire.the ethnic cleansing of the ottoman empire\\'s armenian population, including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of the ottoman empire is considered genocide. the ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the armenian population at the beginning of the war and portrayed deliberately provoked acts of armenian resistance as rebellions to justify further extermination. in early 1915, a number of armenians volunteered to join the russian forces and the ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the tehcir law (law on deportation), which authorised the deportation of armenians from the empire\\'s eastern provinces to syria between 1915 and 1918. the armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by ottoman brigands. while an exact number of deaths is unknown, the international association of genocide scholars estimates 1.5\\xa0million. the government of turkey has consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during world wari; these claims are rejected by most historians.\\n\\nother ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the ottoman empire during this period, including assyrians and greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. at least 250,000 assyrian christians, about half of the population, and 350,000–750,000 anatolian and pontic greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922.\\n\\nrussian empire.many pogroms accompanied the russian revolution of 1917 and the ensuing russian civil war. 60,000–200,000 civilian jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former russian empire (mostly within the pale of settlement in present-day ukraine). there were an estimated 7–12 million casualties during the russian civil war, mostly civilians.\\n\\nrape of belgium.the german invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. in addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential francs-tireurs (guerrillas) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. the german army executed over 6,500 french and belgian civilians between august and november 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior german officers. the german army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at louvain—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. over half the german regiments in belgium were involved in major incidents. thousands of workers were shipped to germany to work in factories. british propaganda dramatising the rape of belgium attracted much attention in the united states, while berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because of the threat of franc-tireurs like those in france in 1870. the british and french magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the united states, where they played a major role in dissolving support for germany.\\n\\nsoldiers\\' experiences.the british soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were conscripted into service. surviving veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their experiences only amongst themselves. grouping together, they formed \"veterans\\' associations\" or \"legions\". a small number of personal accounts of american veterans have been collected by the library of congress veterans history project.\\n\\nprisoners of war.about eight million men surrendered and were held in pow camps during the war. all nations pledged to follow the hague conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for pows was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front. individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered en masse. at the siege of maubeuge about 40,000 french soldiers surrendered, at the battle of galicia russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 austrian captives, at the brusilov offensive about 325,000 to 417,000 germans and austrians surrendered to russians, and at the battle of tannenberg 92,000 russians surrendered. when the besieged garrison of kaunas surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 russians became prisoners, at the battle near przasnysz (february–march 1915) 14,000 germans surrendered to russians, and at the first battle of the marne about 12,000 germans surrendered to the allies. 25–31% of russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for austria-hungary 32%, for italy 26%, for france 12%, for germany 9%; for britain 7%. prisoners from the allied armies totalled about 1.4\\xa0million (not including russia, which lost 2.5–3.5\\xa0million men as prisoners). from the central powers about 3.3\\xa0million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to russians. germany held 2.5\\xa0million prisoners; russia held 2.2–2.9\\xa0million; while britain and france held about 720,000. most were captured just before the armistice. the united states held 48,000. the most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down. once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in world warii), thanks in part to the efforts of the international red cross and inspections by neutral nations. however, conditions were terrible in russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in russia died, and in central powers imprisonment 8% of russians. in germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.\\nthe ottoman empire often treated pows poorly. some 11,800 british empire soldiers, most of them indians, became prisoners after the siege of kut in mesopotamia in april 1916; 4,250 died in captivity. although many were in a poor condition when captured, ottoman officers forced them to march 1100 km to anatolia. a survivor said: \"we were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die.\" the survivors were then forced to build a railway through the taurus mountains.\\n\\nin russia, when the prisoners from the czech legion of the austro-hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the russian civil war.\\n\\nwhile the allied prisoners of the central powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to central power prisoners of the allies and russia, many of whom served as forced labour, e.g., in france until 1920. they were released only after many approaches by the red cross to the allied supreme council. german prisoners were still being held in russia as late as 1924.\\n\\nmilitary attachés and war correspondents.military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern \"embedded\" positions within the opposing land and naval forces.\\n\\nsupport for the war.in the balkans, yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, ante trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of yugoslavs from austria-hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent yugoslavia. the yugoslav committee, led by trumbić, was formed in paris on 30 april 1915 but shortly moved its office to london. in april 1918, the rome congress of oppressed nationalities met, including czechoslovak, italian, polish, transylvanian, and yugoslav representatives who urged the allies to support national self-determination for the peoples residing within austria-hungary.\\n\\nin the middle east, arab nationalism soared in ottoman territories in response to the rise of turkish nationalism during the war, with arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-arab state. in 1916, the arab revolt began in ottoman-controlled territories of the middle east in an effort to achieve independence.\\n\\nin east africa, iyasu v of ethiopia was supporting the dervish state who were at war with the british in the somaliland campaign. von syburg, the german envoy in addis ababa, said, \"now the time has come for ethiopia to regain the coast of the red sea driving the italians home, to restore the empire to its ancient size.\" the ethiopian empire was on the verge of entering world wari on the side of the central powers before iyasu\\'s overthrow due to allied pressure on the ethiopian aristocracy. iyasu was accused of converting to islam. according to ethiopian historian bahru zewde, the evidence used to prove iyasu\\'s conversion was a doctored photo of iyasu wearing a turban provided by the allies. some historians claim the british spy t. e. lawrence forged the iyasu photo.\\n\\na number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in august 1914. but european socialists split on national lines, with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for the war. once the war began, austrian, british, french, german, and russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries\\' intervention in the war.\\n\\nitalian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. one of the most prominent and popular italian nationalist supporters of the war was gabriele d\\'annunzio, who promoted italian irredentism and helped sway the italian public to support intervention in the war. the italian liberal party, under the leadership of paolo boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the allies and used the dante alighieri society to promote italian nationalism. italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including benito mussolini and leonida bissolati. however, the italian socialist party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a general strike called red week. the italian socialist party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including mussolini. mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on italian-populated regions of austria-hungary, formed the pro-interventionist il popolo d\\'italia and the fasci rivoluzionario d\\'azione internazionalista (\"revolutionary fasci for international action\") in october 1914 that later developed into the fasci di combattimento in 1919, the origin of fascism. mussolini\\'s nationalism enabled him to raise funds from ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create il popolo d\\'italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.\\n\\nopposition to the war.once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. among the exceptions were the bolsheviks, the socialist party of america, the italian socialist party, and people like karl liebknecht, rosa luxemburg, and their followers in germany.\\n\\nbenedict xv, elected to the papacy less than three months into world wari, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. in stark contrast to his predecessor, five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. his first encyclical, ad beatissimi apostolorum, given 1november 1914, was concerned with this subject. benedict xv found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers. the 1915 treaty of london between italy and the triple entente included secret provisions whereby the allies agreed with italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the central powers. consequently, the publication of benedict\\'s proposed of august 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except austria-hungary.\\n\\nin britain in 1914, the public schools officers\\' training corps annual camp was held at tidworth pennings, near salisbury plain. head of the british army, lord kitchener, was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war prevented him. general horace smith-dorrien was sent instead. he surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of donald christopher smith, a bermudian cadet who was present),\\nthat war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. in our ignorance i, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a british general who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the general\\'s prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.\\nvoicing these sentiments did not hinder smith-dorrien\\'s career, or prevent him from doing his duty in world wari to the best of his abilities.\\n\\nmany countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. these included eugene debs in the united states and bertrand russell in britain. in the us, the espionage act of 1917 and sedition act of 1918 made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed \"disloyal\". publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors, and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.\\n\\na number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. although the vast majority of irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced irish nationalists staunchly opposed taking part. the war began amid the home rule crisis in ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by july 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in ireland. irish nationalists and marxists attempted to pursue irish independence, culminating in the easter rising of 1916, with germany sending 20,000 rifles to ireland to stir unrest in britain. the uk government placed ireland under martial law in response to the easter rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling. however, opposition to involvement in the war increased in ireland, resulting in the conscription crisis of 1918.\\n\\nother opposition came from conscientious objectors—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight. in britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status. some of them, most notably prominent peace activist stephen henry hobhouse, refused both military and alternative service. many suffered years of prison, including solitary confinement and bread and water diets. even after the war, in britain many job advertisements were marked \"no conscientious objectors need apply\".\\nthe central asian revolt started in the summer of 1916, when the russian empire government ended its exemption of muslims from military service.\\n\\nin 1917, a series of french army mutinies led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.\\n\\non 1–4 may 1917, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of petrograd, and after them, the workers and soldiers of other russian cities, led by the bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading \"down with the war!\" and \"all power to the soviets!\" the mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the russian provisional government. in milan, in may 1917, bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation. the italian army was forced to enter milan with tanks and machine guns to face bolsheviks and anarchists, who fought violently until 23 may when the army gained control of the city. almost 50 people (including three italian soldiers) were killed and over 800 people arrested.\\n\\nin september 1917, russian soldiers in france began questioning why they were fighting for the french at all and mutinied. in russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the october revolution of 1917, with the call going up for \"bread, land, and peace\". the decree on peace, written by vladimir lenin, was passed on 8november 1917, following the success of the october revolution. the bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with germany, the peace of brest-litovsk, despite its harsh conditions. the german revolution of 1918-1919 led to the abdication of the kaiser and german surrender.\\n\\nconscription.conscription was common in most european countries. however, it was controversial in english-speaking countries. it was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the irish catholics in ireland and australia, and the french catholics in canada.\\n\\ncanada.in canada the issue produced a major political crisis that permanently alienated the francophones. it opened a political gap between french canadians, who believed their true loyalty was to canada and not to the british empire, and members of the anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to their british heritage.\\n\\naustralia.australia had a form of conscription at the outbreak of the war, as compulsory military training had been introduced in 1911. however, the defence act 1903 provided that unexempted males could be called upon only for home defence during times of war, not overseas service. prime minister billy hughes wished to amend the legislation to require conscripts to serve overseas, and held two non-binding referendums – one in 1916 and one in 1917 – in order to secure public support. both were defeated by narrow margins, with farmers, the labour movement, the catholic church, and irish-australians combining to campaign for the \"no\" vote. the issue of conscription caused the 1916 australian labor party split. hughes and his supporters were expelled from the party, forming the national labor party and then the nationalist party. despite the referendum results, the nationalists won a landslide victory at the 1917 federal election.\\n\\nbritain.in britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in britain—six of ten million eligible. of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. conscription during the first world war began when the british government passed the military service act in 1916. the act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. there was a system of military service tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. the law went through several changes before the war ended. married men were exempt in the original act, although this was changed in june 1916. the age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy. conscription lasted until mid-1919. due to the political situation in ireland, conscription was never applied there; only in england, scotland and wales.\\n\\nunited states.in the united states, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. the administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1million target in the first six weeks of the war. in 1917 10 million men were registered. this was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3million inducted into the military services. the draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. in all 367,710 black americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).\\n\\nforms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. the most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". the most famous was eugene debs, head of the socialist party of america, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. in 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the thirteenth amendment\\'s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. the supreme court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the selective draft law cases on 7january 1918.\\n\\naustria-hungary.like all the armies of mainland europe, austria-hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. the effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic germans. this was much resented. the army has been described as being \"run on colonial lines\" and the slav soldiers as \"disaffected\". thus conscription contributed greatly to austria\\'s disastrous performance on the battlefield.\\n\\ndiplomacy.the non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. for the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (italy, ottoman empire, bulgaria, romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the central powers, especially among czechs, poles, and arabs. in addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.\\n\\nlegacy and memory.the first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway, more than a century later.\\n\\nhistoriography.historian heather jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: why the war began, why the allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.\\n\\nmemorials.memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the commonwealth war graves commission, the american battle monuments commission, the german war graves commission, and le souvenir français. many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the menin gate memorial and the thiepval memorial to the missing of the somme.\\n\\nin 1915 john mccrae, a canadian army doctor, wrote the poem in flanders fields as a salute to those who perished in the great war. published in punch on 8december 1915, it is still recited today, especially on remembrance day and memorial day.\\n\\nnational world war i museum and memorial in kansas city, missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in world wari. the liberty memorial was dedicated on 1november 1921, when the supreme allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people.\\n\\nthe uk government has budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018. the lead body is the imperial war museum. on 3august 2014, french president francois hollande and german president joachim gauck together marked the centenary of germany\\'s declaration of war on france by laying the first stone of a memorial in vieil armand, known in german as hartmannswillerkopf, for french and german soldiers killed in the war.\\n\\ncultural memory.world war i had a lasting impact on social memory. it was seen by many in britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the victorian period, and across europe many regarded it as a watershed. historian samuel hynes explained:\\n\\nthis has become the most common perception of world war i, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. films such as all quiet on the western front, paths of glory and king & country have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including camrades, poppies of flanders, and shoulder arms indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive. likewise, the art of paul nash, john nash, christopher nevinson, and henry tonks in britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as muirhead bone painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate. several historians like john terraine, niall ferguson and gary sheffield have challenged these interpretations as partial and polemical views:\\n\\nthese beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. in every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. in recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of world wari. it has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. the many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. the war is not now seen as a \\'fight about nothing\\', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. it has been acknowledged that british generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the british army played a major part in the defeat of the germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.\\n\\nthough these views have been discounted as \"myths\", they are common. they have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as \"aimless\" following the contrasting second world war and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. the majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.\\n\\nsocial trauma.the social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.\\n\\nthe optimism of la belle époque was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the lost generation. for years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict\\'s growing mythological status. though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. such historians as dan todman, paul fussell, and samuel heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.\\n\\ndiscontent in germany.the rise of nazism and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. similarly, the popularity of the stab-in-the-back legend (german: dolchstoßlegende) was a testament to the psychological state of defeated germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. this conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the german populace came to see themselves as victims. the widespread acceptance of the \"stab-in-the-back\" theory delegitimised the weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.\\n\\ncommunist and fascist movements around europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. these feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. adolf hitler was able to gain popularity by using german discontent with the still controversial treaty of versailles. world warii was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by world wari. furthermore, it was common for germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of world wari. american historian william rubinstein wrote that:\\n\\nthe \\'age of totalitarianism\\' included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the jewish holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the communist world, other mass killings carried out by nazi germany and its allies, and also the armenian genocide of 1915. all these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern europe as a result of world wari, without which surely neither communism nor fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.\\n\\neconomic effects.one of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in britain, france, the united states, and the dominions of the british empire. to harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. new taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the war effort; many have lasted to this day. similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in austria-hungary and germany.\\n\\ngross domestic product (gdp) increased for three allies (britain, italy, and the united states), but decreased in france and russia, in neutral netherlands, and in the three main central powers. the shrinkage in gdp in austria, russia, france, and the ottoman empire ranged between 30% and 40%. in austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war\\'s end there was no meat.\\n\\nin all nations, the government\\'s share of gdp increased, surpassing 50% in both germany and france and nearly reaching that level in britain. to pay for purchases in the united states, britain cashed in its extensive investments in american railroads and then began borrowing heavily from wall street. president wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in us government lending to the allies. after 1919, the us demanded repayment of these loans. the repayments were, in part, funded by german reparations that, in turn, were supported by american loans to germany. this circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. britain still owed the united states $4.4 billion of world wari debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.\\n\\nmacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. families were altered by the departure of many men. with the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. at the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. this aided the struggle for voting rights for women.\\n\\nworld war i further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of surplus women. the deaths of nearly one million men during the war in britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. the number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. in addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. the war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.\\n\\nin britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. the new system worked smoothly. from 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.\\n\\nbritain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. geologists such as albert ernest kitson were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the african colonies. kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese, used in munitions production, in the gold coast.\\n\\narticle 231 of the treaty of versailles (the so-called \"war guilt\" clause) stated germany accepted responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of germany and her allies.\" it was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with austria and hungary. however neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt.\" in 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132\\xa0billion gold marks. however, \"allied experts knew that germany could not pay\" this sum. the total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being \"deliberately designed to be chimerical\" and its \"primary function was to mislead public opinion\\xa0... into believing the \"total sum was being maintained.\" thus, 50\\xa0billion gold marks (12.5\\xa0billion dollars) \"represented the actual allied assessment of german capacity to pay\" and \"therefore\\xa0... represented the total german reparations\" figure that had to be paid.\\n\\nthis figure could be paid in cash or in kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). in addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the library of louvain. by 1929, the great depression arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world. in 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point germany had paid only the equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations. with the rise of adolf hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. david andelman notes \"refusing to pay doesn\\'t make an agreement null and void. the bonds, the agreement, still exist.\" thus, following the second world war, at the london conference in 1953, germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. on 3october 2010, germany made the final payment on these bonds.\\n\\nthe war contributed to the evolution of the wristwatch from women\\'s jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the pocketwatch, which requires a free hand to operate. military funding of advancements in radio contributed to the postwar popularity of the medium.\\n\\nsee also.- lists of world war i

conflicts in history, with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war, while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide.\\n\\non 28 june 1914, gavrilo princip, a bosnian serb yugoslav nationalist, assassinated the austro-hungarian heir archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo, leading to the july crisis. in response, on 23 july austria-hungary issued an ultimatum to serbia. serbia\\'s reply failed to satisfy the austrians, and the two moved to a war footing.\\n\\na network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the balkans to one involving most of europe. by july 1914, the great powers of europe were divided into two coalitions: the triple entente—consisting of france, russia, and britain—and the triple alliance of germany, austria-hungary, and italy (the triple alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing italy to stay out of the war until april 1915, when it joined the allied powers after its relations with austria-hungary deteriorated). russia felt it necessary to back serbia and, after austria-hungary shelled the serbian capital of belgrade on the 28july, approved partial mobilisation. full russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30july; on the 31st, austria-hungary and germany did the same, while germany demanded russia demobilise within twelve hours. when russia failed to comply, germany declared war on russia on 1august in support of austria-hungary, with austria-hungary following suit on 6august; france ordered full mobilisation in support of russia on 2august.\\n\\ngerman strategy for a war on two fronts against france and russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the west to defeat france within six weeks, then shift forces to the east before russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the schlieffen plan. on 2august, germany demanded free passage through belgium, an essential element in achieving a quick victory over france. when this was refused, german forces invaded belgium on 3august and declared war on france the same day; the belgian government invoked the 1839 treaty of london and in compliance with its obligations under this, britain declared war on germany on 4august. on 12 august, britain and france also declared war on austria-hungary; on the 23august, japan sided with britain, seizing german possessions in china and the pacific. in november 1914, the ottoman empire entered the war on the side of the central powers, opening fronts in the caucasus, mesopotamia, and the sinai peninsula. the war was fought in and drew upon each power\\'s colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to africa and across the globe. the entente and its allies would eventually become known as the allied powers, while the grouping of austria-hungary, germany and their allies would become known as the central powers.\\n\\nthe german advance into france was halted at the battle of the marne and by the end of 1914, the western front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 (the eastern front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). in 1915, italy joined the allied powers and opened a front in the alps. bulgaria joined the central powers in 1915 and greece joined the allies in 1917, expanding the war in the balkans. the united states initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war materiel to the allies. eventually, after the sinking of american merchant ships by german submarines, the declaration by germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and the revelation that germany was trying to incite mexico to make war on the united states, the u.s. declared war on germany on 6april 1917. trained american forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the american expeditionary force would reach some two million troops.\\n\\nthough serbia was defeated in 1915, and romania joined the allied powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917, none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. the 1917 february revolution in russia replaced the tsarist autocracy with the provisional government, but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the october revolution, the creation of the soviet socialist republic, and the signing of the treaty of brest-litovsk by the new government in march 1918, ending russia\\'s involvement in the war. this allowed the transfer of large numbers of german troops from the east to the western front, resulting in the spring offensive. this attack was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the german reserves. the allies held their lines and attacked in the final major battle of the war, the hundred days offensive, a continual series of attacks to which the germans had no reply. bulgaria was the first central power to sign an armistice—the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918. on 30 october, the ottoman empire capitulated, signing the armistice of mudros. on 4november, the austro-hungarian empire agreed to the armistice of villa giusti. with its allies defeated, revolution at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, kaiser wilhelm abdicated on 9november and germany signed an armistice on 11 november 1918, effectively ending the war.\\n\\nworld war i was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. it is considered to mark the end of the second industrial revolution and the pax britannica. the war and its immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings. the big four (britain, france, the united states, and italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 paris peace conference, the most well known being the german peace treaty—the treaty of versailles. ultimately, as a result of the war the austro-hungarian, german, ottoman, and russian empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains. however, despite the conclusive allied victory (and the creation of the league of nations during the peace conference, intended to prevent future wars), a second world war would follow just over twenty years later.\\nnames.the term \"first world war\" was first used in september 1914 by german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared \\'european war\\'\\xa0... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" citing a wire service report in the indianapolis star on 20 september 1914.\\n\\nprior to world war ii, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the great war or simply the world war. in october 1914, the canadian magazine maclean\\'s wrote, \"some wars name themselves. this is the great war.\" contemporary europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" or \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale and devastation. after world warii began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with british empire historians, including canadians, favouring \"the first world war\" and americans \"world wari\".\\n\\npolitical and military alliances.for much of the 19th century, the major european powers had tried to maintain a tenuous balance of power among themselves, resulting in a complex network of political and military alliances. the biggest challenges to this were britain\\'s withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the ottoman empire and the post-1848 rise of prussia under otto von bismarck. victory in the 1866 austro-prussian war established prussian hegemony in germany, while victory over france in the 1870–1871 franco-prussian war unified the german states into a german reich under prussian leadership.\\n\\nin 1873, to isolate france and avoid a war on two fronts, bismarck negotiated the league of the three emperors (german: dreikaiserbund) between austria-hungary, russia and germany. concerned by russia\\'s victory in the 1877–1878 russo-turkish war and their influence in the balkans, the league was dissolved in 1878, with germany and austria-hungary subsequently forming the 1879 dual alliance; this became the triple alliance when italy joined in 1882.\\n\\nthe practical details of these alliances were limited, since their primary purpose was to ensure cooperation between the three imperial powers and isolate france. attempts by britain in 1880 to resolve colonial tensions with russia and diplomatic moves by france led to bismarck reforming the league in 1881. when the league finally lapsed in 1887, it was replaced by the reinsurance treaty, a secret agreement between germany and russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by france or austria-hungary.\\n\\nin 1890, the new german emperor, kaiser wilhelm ii, forced bismarck to retire and was persuaded not to renew the reinsurance treaty by the new chancellor, leo von caprivi. this allowed france to counteract the triple alliance with the franco-russian alliance of 1894 and the 1904 entente cordiale with britain, while in 1907 britain and russia signed the anglo-russian convention. the agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made british entry into any future conflict involving france or russia a possibility; these interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the triple entente.\\n\\narms race.the creation of the german reich following victory in the 1871 franco-prussian war led to a massive increase in germany\\'s economic and industrial strength. admiral alfred von tirpitz and wilhelm ii, who became emperor in 1890, sought to use that to create a kaiserliche marine or imperial german navy to compete with britain\\'s royal navy for world naval supremacy. in doing so, they were influenced by us naval strategist alfred mahan, who argued possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; tirpitz translated his books into german and wilhelm made them required reading. however, it was also driven by wilhelm\\'s admiration of the royal navy and desire to outdo it.\\n\\nthis resulted in the anglo-german naval arms race but the launch of in 1906 gave the royal navy a technological advantage over its german rival, which they never lost. ultimately, the race diverted huge resources to creating a german navy large enough to antagonise britain, but not defeat it. in 1911, chancellor theobald von bethmann-hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading to the rüstungswende or ‘armaments turning point\\', when germany switched expenditure from the navy to the army.\\n\\nthis was driven by russia\\'s recovery from the 1905 revolution, specifically increased investment post 1908 in railways and infrastructure in its western border regions. germany and austria-hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for fewer numbers; it was concern at the closing of this gap that led to the end of the naval race, rather than a reduction in tension elsewhere. when germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, france extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the balkan powers and italy led to increased expenditure by the ottomans and austria-hungary. absolute figures are hard to calculate, due to differences in categorising expenditure, while they often omit civilian infrastructure projects with a military use, such as railways. however, from 1908 to 1913, defence spending by the six major european powers increased by over 50% in real terms.\\n\\nconflicts in the balkans.in october 1908, austria-hungary precipitated the bosnian crisis of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former ottoman territory of bosnia and herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. this angered the kingdom of serbia and its patron, the pan-slavic and orthodox russian empire. russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the balkans, which came to be known as the \"powder keg of europe\".\\n\\nin 1912 and 1913, the first balkan war was fought between the balkan league and the fracturing ottoman empire. the resulting treaty of london further shrank the ottoman empire, creating an independent albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of bulgaria, serbia, montenegro, and greece. when bulgaria attacked serbia and greece on 16 june 1913, it sparked the 33-day second balkan war, by the end of which it lost most of macedonia to serbia and greece, and southern dobruja to romania, further destabilising the region. the great powers were able to keep these balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout europe and beyond.\\n\\nsarajevo assassination.on 28 june 1914, archduke franz ferdinand, heir presumptive to the austro-hungarian empire, visited the bosnian capital, sarajevo. a group of six assassins (cvjetko popović, gavrilo princip, muhamed mehmedbašić, nedeljko čabrinović, trifko grabež, and vaso čubrilović) from the yugoslavist group mlada bosna, supplied with arms by the serbian black hand, gathered on the street where the archduke\\'s motorcade was to pass, with the intention of assassinating him. the political objective of the assassination was to break off austria-hungary\\'s south slav provinces, which austria-hungary had annexed from the ottoman empire, so they could be combined into a yugoslavia.\\n\\nčabrinović threw a grenade at the car, but missed. some nearby were injured by the blast, but ferdinand\\'s convoy carried on. the other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them.\\n\\nabout an hour later, when ferdinand was returning from a visit at the sarajevo hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, princip stood. with a pistol, princip shot and killed ferdinand and his wife sophie. although they were reportedly not personally close, the emperor franz joseph was profoundly shocked and upset. the reaction among the people in austria, however, was mild, almost indifferent. as historian zbyněk zeman later wrote, \"the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. on sunday and monday (28 and 29 june), the crowds in vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.\" nevertheless, the political effect of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and was described by historian christopher clark on the bbc radio4 series month of madness as a \"9/11 effect, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in vienna.\"\\n\\nexpansion of violence in bosnia and herzegovina.the austro-hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent anti-serb riots in sarajevo, in which bosnian croats and bosniaks killed two bosnian serbs and damaged numerous serb-owned buildings. violent actions against ethnic serbs were also organised outside sarajevo, in other cities in austro-hungarian-controlled bosnia and herzegovina, croatia and slovenia. austro-hungarian authorities in bosnia and herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. a further 460 serbs were sentenced to death. a predominantly bosniak special militia known as the schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of serbs.\\n\\njuly crisis.the assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between austria-hungary, germany, russia, france and britain, called the july crisis. austria-hungary correctly believed that serbian officials (especially the officers of the black hand) were involved in the plot to murder the archduke, and wanted to finally end serbian interference in bosnia. on 23july, austria-hungary delivered to serbia the july ultimatum, a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with serbia. serbia decreed general mobilisation on 25july. serbia accepted all the terms of the ultimatum except for article six, which demanded that austrian delegates be allowed in serbia for the purpose of participation in the investigation into the assassination. following this, austria broke off diplomatic relations with serbia and, the next day, ordered a partial mobilisation. finally, on 28 july 1914, a month after the assassination, austria-hungary declared war on serbia.\\non 25july, russia, in support of serbia, declared partial mobilisation against austria-hungary. on 30july, russia ordered general mobilisation. german chancellor bethmann-hollweg waited until the 31st for an appropriate response, when germany declared erklärung des kriegszustandes, or \"statement on the war status\". kaiser wilhelm ii asked his cousin, tsar nicolas ii, to suspend the russian general mobilisation. when he refused, germany issued an ultimatum demanding its mobilisation be stopped, and a commitment not to support serbia. another was sent to france, asking her not to support russia if it were to come to the defence of serbia. on 1august, after the russian response, germany mobilised and declared war on russia. this also led to the general mobilisation in austria-hungary on 4august.\\n\\nthe german government issued demands to france that it remain neutral as they had to decide which deployment plan to implement, it being extremely difficult to change the deployment whilst it was underway. the modified german schlieffen plan, aufmarsch ii west, would deploy 80% of the army in the west, while aufmarsch i ost and aufmarsch ii ost would deploy 60% in the west and 40% in the east. the french did not respond, but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw 10 km from the border to avoid any incidents, and at the same time ordered the mobilisation of their reserves. germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing aufmarsch ii west.\\n\\non 1 august, wilhelm ordered general helmuth von moltke the younger to \"march the whole of the... army to the east\" after being wrongly informed that the british would remain neutral if france was not attacked. moltke told the kaiser that attempting to redeploy a million men was unthinkable, and that making it possible for the french to attack the germans \"in the rear\" would prove disastrous. yet wilhelm insisted that the german army should not march into luxembourg until he received a telegram sent by his cousin george v, who made it clear that there had been a misunderstanding. eventually the kaiser told moltke, \"now you can do what you want.\"\\n\\non 2 august, germany occupied luxembourg, and on 3august declared war on france; on the same day, they sent the belgian government an ultimatum demanding unimpeded right of way through any part of belgium, which was refused. early on the morning of 4august, the germans invaded; king albert ordered his military to resist and called for assistance under the 1839 treaty of london. britain demanded germany comply with the treaty and respect belgian neutrality; it declared war on germany at 19:00\\xa0utc on 4august 1914 (effective from 23:00), following an \"unsatisfactory reply\".\\n\\nconfusion among the central powers.the strategy of the central powers suffered from miscommunication. germany had promised to support austria-hungary\\'s invasion of serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises. austro-hungarian leaders believed germany would cover its northern flank against russia. germany, however, envisioned austria-hungary directing most of its troops against russia, while germany dealt with france. this confusion forced the austro-hungarian army to divide its forces between the russian and serbian fronts.\\n\\nserbian campaign.austria invaded and fought the serbian army at the battle of cer and battle of kolubara beginning on 12 august. over the next two weeks, austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major allied victories of the war and dashed austro-hungarian hopes of a swift victory. as a result, austria had to keep sizeable forces on the serbian front, weakening its efforts against russia. serbia\\'s defeat of the austro-hungarian invasion of 1914 has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century. the campaign saw the very first use of medical evacuation by the serbian army in autumn of 1915 and anti-aircraft warfare in the spring of 1915 after an austrian plane was shot down with ground-to-air fire.\\n\\ngerman offensive in belgium and france.when the war began, the german order of battle placed 80% of the army in the west, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the east. the plan was to quickly knock france out of the war, then redeploy to the east and do the same to russia.\\n\\nthe german offensive in the west was officially titled aufmarsch ii west, but is better known as the schlieffen plan, after its original creator. schlieffen deliberately kept the german left (i.e. its positions in alsace-lorraine) weak to lure the french into attacking there, while the majority were allocated to the german right, so as to sweep through belgium, encircle paris and trap the french armies against the swiss border (the french charged into alsace-lorraine on the outbreak of war as envisaged by their plan xvii, thus actually aiding this strategy). however, schlieffen\\'s successor moltke grew concerned that the french might push too hard on his left flank. as such, as the german army increased in size in the years leading up to the war, he changed the allocation of forces between the german right and left wings from 85:15 to 70:30. ultimately, moltke\\'s changes meant insufficient forces to achieve decisive success and thus unrealistic goals and timings.\\n\\nthe initial german advance in the west was very successful: by the end of august the allied left, which included the british expeditionary force (bef), was in full retreat; french casualties in the first month exceeded 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 august during the battle of the frontiers. german planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914, von kluck used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the german armies as they closed on paris. the french and british exploited this gap to halt the german advance east of paris at the first battle of the marne from 5to 12 september and push the german forces back some 50 km.\\n\\nin 1911, the russian stavka had agreed with the french to attack germany within 15 days of mobilisation; this was unrealistic and the two russian armies that entered east prussia on 17 august did so without many of their support elements. the russian second army was effectively destroyed at the battle of tannenberg on 26–30 august but the russian advance caused the germans to re-route their 8th field army from france to east prussia, a factor in allied victory on the marne.\\n\\nby the end of 1914, german troops held strong defensive positions inside france, controlled the bulk of france\\'s domestic coalfields and had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. however, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war. this amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the marne, crown prince wilhelm told an american reporter; \"we have lost the war. it will go on for a long time but lost it is already.\"\\n\\nasia and the pacific.new zealand occupied german samoa (later western samoa) on 30 august 1914. on 11 september, the australian naval and military expeditionary force landed on the island of neu pommern (later new britain), which formed part of german new guinea. on 28 october, the german cruiser sank the russian cruiser zhemchug in the battle of penang. japan seized germany\\'s micronesian colonies and, after the siege of tsingtao, the german coaling port of qingdao on the chinese shandong peninsula. as vienna refused to withdraw the austro-hungarian cruiser from tsingtao, japan declared war not only on germany, but also on austria-hungary; the ship participated in the defence of tsingtao where it was sunk in november 1914. within a few months, the allied forces had seized all the german territories in the pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in new guinea remained.\\n\\nafrican campaigns.some of the first clashes of the war involved british, french, and german colonial forces in africa. on 6–7 august, french and british troops invaded the german protectorate of togoland and kamerun. on 10 august, german forces in south-west africa attacked south africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. the german colonial forces in german east africa, led by colonel paul von lettow-vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during world wari and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in europe.\\n\\nindian support for the allies.germany attempted to use indian nationalism and pan-islamism to its advantage, instigating uprisings in india, and sending a mission that urged afghanistan to join the war on the side of central powers. however, contrary to british fears of a revolt in india, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards britain. indian political leaders from the indian national congress and other groups were eager to support the british war effort, since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of indian home rule. the indian army in fact outnumbered the british army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3\\xa0million indian soldiers and labourers served in europe, africa, and the middle east, while the central government and the princely states sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. in all, 140,000\\xa0men served on the western front and nearly 700,000 in the middle east. casualties of indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during world wari.\\nthe suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the british government to grant self-government to india after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and fuelled the campaign for full independence that would be led by mohandas k. gandhi and others.\\n\\ntrench warfare begins.military tactics developed before world war i failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. these advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult. commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. in time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.\\n\\nafter the first battle of the marne (5–12 september 1914), allied and german forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the \"race to the sea\". by the end of 1914, the opposing forces were left confronting each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from alsace to belgium\\'s north sea coast. since the germans were able to choose where to stand, they normally had the advantage of the high ground; in addition, their trenches tended to be better built, since anglo-french trenches were initially intended as \"temporary,\" preparatory to breaking the german defences.\\n\\nboth sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. on 22 april 1915, at the second battle of ypres, the germans (violating the hague convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front. several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. tanks were developed by britain and france and were first used in combat by the british during the battle of flers–courcelette (part of the battle of the somme) on 15 september 1916, with only partial success. however, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the germans employed only a few of their own design, supplemented by captured allied tanks.\\n\\ncontinuation of trench warfare.neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. throughout 1915–17, the british empire and france suffered more casualties than germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. strategically, while the germans mounted only one major offensive, the allies made several attempts to break through the german lines.\\n\\nin february 1916 the germans attacked french defensive positions at the battle of verdun, lasting until december 1916. the germans made initial gains, before french counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. casualties were greater for the french, but the germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. verdun became a symbol of french determination and self-sacrifice.\\n\\nthe battle of the somme was an anglo-french offensive of july to november 1916. the opening day of the offensive (1 july 1916) was the bloodiest day in the history of the british army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. the entire somme offensive cost the british army some 420,000 casualties. the french suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the germans an estimated 500,000. gun fire was not the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. the living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties (body lice) and the \\'spanish flu\\'.\\n\\nto maintain morale, wartime censors minimised early reports of widespread influenza illness and mortality in germany, the united kingdom, france, and the united states. papers were free to report the epidemic\\'s effects in neutral spain (such as the grave illness of king alfonso xiii). this created a false impression of spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic\\'s nickname, \"spanish flu\".\\n\\nprotracted action at verdun throughout 1916, combined with the bloodletting at the somme, brought the exhausted french army to the brink of collapse. futile attempts using frontal assault came at a high price for both the british and the french and led to the widespread french army mutinies, after the failure of the costly nivelle offensive of april–may 1917. the concurrent british battle of arras was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value. a smaller part of the arras offensive, the capture of vimy ridge by the canadian corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that canada\\'s national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of canada.\\n\\nthe last large-scale offensive of this period was a british attack (with french support) at passchendaele (july–november 1917). this offensive opened with great promise for the allies, before bogging down in the october mud. casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.\\n\\nthe years of trench warfare on the western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. however, throughout this period, british, french, and german tactics constantly evolved to meet new battlefield challenges.\\n\\nnaval war.at the start of the war, the german empire had cruisers scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping. the british royal navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect allied shipping. before the beginning of the war, it was widely understood that britain held the position of strongest, most influential navy in the world. the publishing of the book the influence of sea power upon history by alfred thayer mahan in 1890 was intended to encourage the united states to increase their naval power. instead, this book made it to germany and inspired its readers to try to over-power the british royal navy. for example, the german detached light cruiser , part of the east asia squadron stationed at qingdao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a russian cruiser and a french destroyer. however, most of the german east-asia squadron—consisting of the armoured cruisers and , light cruisers and and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to germany when it met british warships. the german flotilla and sank two armoured cruisers at the battle of coronel, but was virtually destroyed at the battle of the falkland islands in december 1914, with only dresden and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the battle of más a tierra these too had been destroyed or interned.\\n\\nsoon after the outbreak of hostilities, britain began a naval blockade of germany. the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries. britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships. since there was limited response to this tactic of the british, germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.\\n\\nthe battle of jutland (german: skagerrakschlacht, or \"battle of the skagerrak\") in may/june 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war. it was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. the kaiserliche marine\\'s high seas fleet, commanded by vice admiral reinhard scheer, fought the royal navy\\'s grand fleet, led by admiral sir john jellicoe. the engagement was a stand off, as the germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger british fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the british fleet than they received. strategically, however, the british asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the german surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.\\n\\ngerman u-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain. the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival. the united states launched a protest, and germany changed its rules of engagement. after the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in 1915, germany promised not to target passenger liners, while britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the \"cruiser rules\", which demanded warning and movement of crews to \"a place of safety\" (a standard that lifeboats did not meet). finally, in early 1917, germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising the americans would eventually enter the war. germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the united states could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.\\n\\nthe u-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers. this tactic made it difficult for u-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. the solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the north atlantic in convoys. the u-boats had sunk more than 5,000 allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.\\n\\nworld war i also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july 1918, as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.\\n\\nwar in the balkans.faced with russia in the east, austria-hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack serbia. after suffering heavy losses, the austrians briefly occupied the serbian capital, belgrade. a serbian counter-attack in the battle of kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. for the first ten months of 1915, austria-hungary used most of its military reserves to fight italy. german and austro-hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading bulgaria to join the attack on serbia. the austro-hungarian provinces of slovenia, croatia and bosnia provided troops for austria-hungary in the fight with serbia, russia and italy. montenegro allied itself with serbia.\\n\\nbulgaria declared war on serbia on 12 october 1915 and joined in the attack by the austro-hungarian army under mackensen\\'s army of 250,000 that was already underway. serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the central powers, now including bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops total. the serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern albania. the serbs suffered defeat in the battle of kosovo. montenegro covered the serbian retreat towards the adriatic coast in the battle of mojkovac in 6–7 january 1916, but ultimately the austrians also conquered montenegro. the surviving serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to greece. after conquest, serbia was divided between austro-hungary and bulgaria.\\n\\nin late 1915, a franco-british force landed at salonica in greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the central powers. however, the pro-german king constantine i dismissed the pro-allied government of eleftherios venizelos before the allied expeditionary force arrived. the friction between the king of greece and the allies continued to accumulate with the national schism, which effectively divided greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of venizelos in salonica. after intense negotiations and an armed confrontation in athens between allied and royalist forces (an incident known as noemvriana), the king of greece resigned and his second son alexander took his place; greece officially joined the war on the side of the allies in june 1917.\\n\\nthe macedonian front was initially mostly static. french and serbian forces retook limited areas of macedonia by recapturing bitola on 19 november 1916 following the costly monastir offensive, which brought stabilisation of the front.\\n\\nserbian and french troops finally made a breakthrough in september 1918 in the vardar offensive, after most of the german and austro-hungarian troops had been withdrawn. the bulgarians were defeated at the battle of dobro pole, and by 25 september british and french troops had crossed the border into bulgaria proper as the bulgarian army collapsed. bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 september 1918. the german high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.\\n\\nthe disappearance of the macedonian front meant that the road to budapest and vienna was now opened to allied forces. hindenburg and ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the central powers and, a day after the bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.\\n\\nottoman empire.the ottomans threatened russia\\'s caucasian territories and britain\\'s communications with india via the suez canal. as the conflict progressed, the ottoman empire took advantage of the european powers\\' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous armenian, greek, and assyrian christian populations, known as the armenian genocide, greek genocide, and assyrian genocide.\\n\\nthe british and french opened overseas fronts with the gallipoli (1915) and mesopotamian campaigns (1914). in gallipoli, the ottoman empire successfully repelled the british, french, and australian and new zealand army corps (anzacs). in mesopotamia, by contrast, after the defeat of the british defenders in the siege of kut by the ottomans (1915–16), british imperial forces reorganised and captured baghdad in march 1917. the british were aided in mesopotamia by local arab and assyrian tribesmen, while the ottomans employed local kurdish and turcoman tribes.\\n\\nfurther to the west, the suez canal was defended from ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in august, a german and ottoman force was defeated at the battle of romani by the anzac mounted division and the 52nd (lowland) infantry division. following this victory, an egyptian expeditionary force advanced across the sinai peninsula, pushing ottoman forces back in the battle of magdhaba in december and the battle of rafa on the border between the egyptian sinai and ottoman palestine in january 1917.\\n\\nrussian armies generally had success in the caucasus. enver pasha, supreme commander of the ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central asia and areas that had been lost to russia previously. he was, however, a poor commander. he launched an offensive against the russians in the caucasus in december 1914 with 100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous russian positions in winter. he lost 86% of his force at the battle of sarikamish.\\n\\nthe ottoman empire, with german support, invaded persia (modern iran) in december 1914 in an effort to cut off british and russian access to petroleum reservoirs around baku near the caspian sea. persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of british and russian influence. the ottomans and germans were aided by kurdish and azeri forces, together with a large number of major iranian tribes, such as the qashqai, tangistanis, luristanis, and khamseh, while the russians and british had the support of armenian and assyrian forces. the persian campaign was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the ottomans and their allies. however, the russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to armenian and assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards british lines in northern mesopotamia.\\n\\ngeneral yudenich, the russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the turks out of most of the southern caucasus with a string of victories. in 1917, russian grand duke nicholas assumed command of the caucasus front. nicholas planned a railway from russian georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. however, in march 1917 (february in the pre-revolutionary russian calendar), the tsar abdicated in the course of the february revolution, and the russian caucasus army began to fall apart.\\n\\nthe arab revolt, instigated by the arab bureau of the british foreign office, started june 1916 with the battle of mecca, led by sherif hussein of mecca, and ended with the ottoman surrender of damascus. fakhri pasha, the ottoman commander of medina, resisted for more than two and half years during the siege of medina before surrendering in january 1919.\\n\\nthe senussi tribe, along the border of italian libya and british egypt, incited and armed by the turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against allied troops. the british were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the senussi campaign. their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.\\n\\ntotal allied casualties on the ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men. total ottoman casualties were 725,000 (325,000 dead and 400,000 wounded).\\n\\nitalian participation.italy had been allied with the german and austro-hungarian empires since 1882 as part of the triple alliance. however, the nation had its own designs on austrian territory in trentino, the austrian littoral, fiume (rijeka) and dalmatia. rome had a secret 1902 pact with france, effectively nullifying its part in the triple alliance; italy secretly agreed with france to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by germany. at the start of hostilities, italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the triple alliance was defensive and that austria-hungary was an aggressor. the austro-hungarian government began negotiations to secure italian neutrality, offering the french colony of tunisia in return. the allies made a counter-offer in which italy would receive the southern tyrol, austrian littoral and territory on the dalmatian coast after the defeat of austria-hungary. this was formalised by the treaty of london. further encouraged by the allied invasion of turkey in april 1915, italy joined the triple entente and declared war on austria-hungary on 23 may. fifteen months later, italy declared war on germany.\\n\\nthe italians had numerical superiority, but this advantage was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which the fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. field marshal luigi cadorna, a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the slovenian plateau, taking ljubljana and threatening vienna.\\n\\non the trentino front, the austro-hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. after an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while austrian kaiserschützen and standschützen engaged italian alpini in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. the austro-hungarians counterattacked in the altopiano of asiago, towards verona and padua, in the spring of 1916 (strafexpedition), but made little progress and were defeated by the italians.\\n\\nbeginning in 1915, the italians under cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the isonzo front along the isonzo (soča) river, northeast of trieste. of these eleven offensives, five were won by italy, three remained inconclusive, and the other three were repelled by the austro-hungarians, who held the higher ground. in the summer of 1916, after the battle of doberdò, the italians captured the town of gorizia. after this victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several italian offensives, centred on the banjšice and karst plateau east of gorizia.\\n\\nthe central powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 october 1917, spearheaded by the germans, and achieved a victory at caporetto (kobarid). the italian army was routed and retreated more than 100 km to reorganise. the new italian chief of staff, armando diaz, ordered the army to stop their retreat and defend the monte grappa summit, where fortified defenses were constructed; the italians repelled the austro-hungarian and german army, and stabilised the front at the piave river. since the italian army had suffered heavy losses in the battle of caporetto, the italian government ordered conscription of the so-called 99 boys (ragazzi del \\'99): all males born in 1899 and prior, who were 18 years old or older. in 1918, the austro-hungarians failed to break through in a series of battles on the piave and were finally decisively defeated in the battle of vittorio veneto in october. on 1november, the italian navy destroyed much of the austro-hungarian fleet stationed in pula, preventing it from being handed over to the new state of slovenes, croats and serbs. on 3november, the italians invaded trieste from the sea. on the same day, the armistice of villa giusti was signed. by mid-november 1918, the italian military occupied the entire former austrian littoral and had seized control of the portion of dalmatia that had been guaranteed to italy by the london pact. by the end of hostilities in november 1918, admiral enrico millo declared himself italy\\'s governor of dalmatia. austria-hungary surrendered on 11 november 1918.\\n\\nromanian participation.romania had been allied with the central powers since 1882. when the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because austria-hungary had itself declared war on serbia, romania was under no obligation to join the war. on 4august 1916, romania and the entente signed the political treaty and military convention, that established the coordinates of romania\\'s participation in the war. in return, it received the allies\\' formal sanction for transylvania, banat and other territories of austria-hungary to be annexed to romania. the action had large popular support. on 27 august 1916, the romanian army launched an attack against austria-hungary, with limited russian support. the romanian offensive was initially successful in transylvania, but a central powers counterattack by the drove them back. as a result of the battle of bucharest, the central powers occupied bucharest on 6december 1916. fighting in moldova continued in 1917, but russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the october revolution meant that romania was forced to sign an armistice with the central powers on 9december 1917.\\n\\nin january 1918, romanian forces established control over bessarabia as the russian army abandoned the province. although a treaty was signed by the romanian and bolshevik russian governments following talks between 5and 9march 1918 on the withdrawal of romanian forces from bessarabia within two months, on 27 march 1918 romania formally attached bessarabia, inhabited by a romanian majority, to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with romania.\\n\\nromania officially made peace with the central powers by signing the treaty of bucharest on 7may 1918. under the treaty, romania was obliged to end the war with the central powers and make small territorial concessions to austria-hungary, ceding control of some passes in the carpathian mountains, and to grant oil concessions to germany. in exchange, the central powers recognised the sovereignty of romania over bessarabia. the treaty was renounced in october 1918 by the alexandru marghiloman government, and romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 november 1918 against the central powers. the next day, the treaty of bucharest was nullified by the terms of the armistice of compiègne. total romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.\\n\\ninitial actions.russian plans for the start of the war called for simultaneous invasions of austrian galicia and east prussia. although russia\\'s initial advance into galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from east prussia by hindenburg and ludendorff at the battles of tannenberg and the masurian lakes in august and september 1914. russia\\'s less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership were instrumental in the events that unfolded. by the spring of 1915, the russians had retreated to galicia, and, in may, the central powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on poland\\'s southern frontiers with their gorlice–tarnów offensive. on 5august, they captured warsaw and forced the russians to withdraw from poland.\\n\\nrussian revolution.despite russia\\'s success in the june 1916 brusilov offensive against the austrians in eastern galicia, the offensive was undermined by the reluctance of other russian generals to commit their forces to support the victory. allied and russian forces were revived only briefly by romania\\'s entry into the war on 27 august, as romania was rapidly defeated by a central powers offensive. meanwhile, unrest grew in russia as the tsar remained at the front. the increasingly incompetent rule of empress alexandra drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, rasputin, at the end of 1916.\\nin march 1917, demonstrations in petrograd culminated in the abdication of tsar nicholas ii and the appointment of a weak provisional government, which shared power with the petrograd soviet socialists. this arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. the army became increasingly ineffective.\\n\\nfollowing the tsar\\'s abdication, vladimir lenin—with the help of the german government—was ushered by train from switzerland into russia 16 april 1917. discontent and the weaknesses of the provisional government led to a rise in the popularity of the bolshevik party, led by lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. the revolution of november was followed in december by an armistice and negotiations with germany. at first, the bolsheviks refused the german terms, but when german troops began marching across ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the treaty of brest-litovsk on 3march 1918. the treaty ceded vast territories, including finland, the baltic provinces, parts of poland and ukraine to the central powers. despite this enormous german success, the manpower required by the germans to occupy the captured territory may have contributed to the failure of their spring offensive, and secured relatively little food or other materiel for the central powers war effort.\\n\\nwith the adoption of the treaty of brest-litovsk, the entente no longer existed. the allied powers led a small-scale invasion of russia, partly to stop germany from exploiting russian resources, and to a lesser extent, to support the \"whites\" (as opposed to the \"reds\") in the russian civil war. allied troops landed in arkhangelsk and in vladivostok as part of the north russia intervention.\\n\\nczechoslovak legion.the czechoslovak legion fought on the side of the entente. its goal was to win support for the independence of czechoslovakia. the legion in russia was established in september 1914, in december 1917 in france (including volunteers from america) and in april 1918 in italy. czechoslovak legion troops defeated the austro-hungarian army at the ukrainian village of zborov, in july 1917. after this success, the number of czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as czechoslovak military power. in the battle of bakhmach, the legion defeated the germans and forced them to make a truce.\\n\\nin russia, they were heavily involved in the russian civil war, siding with the whites against the bolsheviks, at times controlling most of the trans-siberian railway and conquering all the major cities of siberia. the presence of the czechoslovak legion near yekaterinburg appears to have been one of the motivations for the bolshevik execution of the tsar and his family in july 1918. legionaries arrived less than a week afterwards and captured the city. because russia\\'s european ports were not safe, the corps was evacuated by a long detour via the port of vladivostok. the last transport was the american ship heffron in september 1920.\\n\\ncentral powers peace overtures.on 12 december 1916, after ten brutal months of the battle of verdun and a successful offensive against romania, germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the allies. however, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a \"duplicitous war ruse\".\\n\\nsoon after, the us president, woodrow wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. lloyd george\\'s war cabinet considered the german offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the allies. after initial outrage and much deliberation, they took wilson\\'s note as a separate effort, signalling that the united states was on the verge of entering the war against germany following the \"submarine outrages\". while the allies debated a response to wilson\\'s offer, the germans chose to rebuff it in favour of \"a direct exchange of views\". learning of the german response, the allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 january. they sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for france, russia and romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. this included the liberation of italians, slavs, romanians, czecho-slovaks, and the creation of a \"free and united poland\". on the question of security, the allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement. the negotiations failed and the entente powers rejected the german offer on the grounds that germany had not put forward any specific proposals.\\n\\n1917–1918.events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.\\n\\ndevelopments in 1917.the british naval blockade began to have a serious impact on germany. in response, in february 1917, the german general staff convinced chancellor theobald von bethmann-hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving britain out of the war. german planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. the general staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the united states into the conflict, but calculated that british shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before american intervention could have an effect. tonnage sunk rose above 500,000\\xa0tons per month from february to july. it peaked at 860,000\\xa0tons in april. after july, the newly re-introduced convoy system became effective in reducing the u-boat threat. britain was safe from starvation, while german industrial output fell, and the united states joined the war far earlier than germany had anticipated.\\n\\non 3 may 1917, during the nivelle offensive, the french 2nd colonial division, veterans of the battle of verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. the french army mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 french divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. however, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the french soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action. robert nivelle was removed from command by 15 may, replaced by general philippe pétain, who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.\\n\\nthe victory of the central powers at the battle of caporetto led the allies to convene the rapallo conference at which they formed the supreme war council to co-ordinate planning. previously, british and french armies had operated under separate commands.\\n\\nin december, the central powers signed an armistice with russia, thus freeing large numbers of german troops for use in the west. with german reinforcements and new american troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the western front. the central powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in europe. thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.\\n\\nin 1917, emperor charles i of austria secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with clemenceau, through his wife\\'s brother sixtus in belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of germany. italy opposed the proposals. when the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.\\n\\nottoman empire conflict, 1917–1918.in march and april 1917, at the first and second battles of gaza, german and ottoman forces stopped the advance of the egyptian expeditionary force, which had begun in august 1916 at the battle of romani.\\nat the end of october, the sinai and palestine campaign resumed, when general edmund allenby\\'s xxth corps, xxi corps and desert mounted corps won the battle of beersheba. two ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the battle of mughar ridge and, early in december, jerusalem was captured following another ottoman defeat at the battle of jerusalem. about this time, friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the eighth army\\'s commander, replaced by djevad pasha, and a few months later the commander of the ottoman army in palestine, erich von falkenhayn, was replaced by otto liman von sanders.\\n\\nin early 1918, the front line was extended and the jordan valley was occupied, following the first transjordan and the second transjordan attacks by british empire forces in march and april 1918. in march, most of the egyptian expeditionary force\\'s british infantry and yeomanry cavalry were sent to the western front as a consequence of the spring offensive. they were replaced by indian army units. during several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a number of attacks were carried out on sections of the ottoman front line. these pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived indian army infantry. it was not until the middle of september that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.\\n\\nthe reorganised egyptian expeditionary force, with an additional mounted division, broke ottoman forces at the battle of megiddo in september 1918. in two days the british and indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the eighth army (ottoman empire) at tulkarm, the continuous trench lines at tabsor, arara, and the seventh army (ottoman empire) headquarters at nablus. the desert mounted corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry. during virtually continuous operations by australian light horse, british mounted yeomanry, indian lancers, and new zealand mounted rifle brigades in the jezreel valley, they captured nazareth, afulah and beisan, jenin, along with haifa on the mediterranean coast and daraa east of the jordan river on the hejaz railway. samakh and tiberias on the sea of galilee were captured on the way northwards to damascus. meanwhile, chaytor\\'s force of australian light horse, new zealand mounted rifles, indian, british west indies and jewish infantry captured the crossings of the jordan river, es salt, amman and at ziza most of the fourth army (ottoman empire). the armistice of mudros, signed at the end of october, ended hostilities with the ottoman empire when fighting was continuing north of aleppo.\\n\\n15 august 1917: peace offer by the pope.on or shortly before 15 august 1917 pope benedict xv made a peace proposal suggesting:\\n- no annexations\\n- no indemnities, except to compensate for severe war damage in belgium and parts of france and of serbia\\n- a solution to the problems of alsace-lorraine, trentino and trieste\\n- restoration of the kingdom of poland\\n- germany to pull out of belgium and france\\n- germany\\'s overseas colonies to be returned to germany\\n- general disarmament\\n- a supreme court of arbitration to settle future disputes between nations\\n- the freedom of the seas\\n- abolish all retaliatory economic conflicts\\n- no point in ordering reparations, because so much damage had been caused to all belligerents\\n\\nentry of the united states.at the outbreak of the war, the united states pursued a policy of non-intervention, avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. when the german u-boat u-20 sank the british liner rms lusitania on 7may 1915 with 128 americans among the dead, president woodrow wilson insisted that america is \"too proud to fight\" but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. germany complied. wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. however, he also repeatedly warned that the united states would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. former president theodore roosevelt denounced german acts as \"piracy\". wilson was narrowly re-elected in 1916 after campaigning with the slogan \"he kept us out of war\".\\n\\nin january 1917, germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, in the hopes of starving britain into surrender. germany did this realising it would mean american entry. the german foreign minister, in the zimmermann telegram, invited mexico to join the war as germany\\'s ally against the united states. in return, the germans would finance mexico\\'s war and help it recover the territories of texas, new mexico, and arizona. the united kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the us embassy in the uk. from there it made its way to president wilson who released the zimmermann note to the public, and americans saw it as casus belli. wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. he argued that the war was so important that the us had to have a voice in the peace conference. after the sinking of seven us merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the zimmermann telegram, wilson called for war on germany on 2april 1917, which the us congress declared 4days later.\\n\\nthe united states was never formally a member of the allies but became a self-styled \"associated power\". the united states had a small army, but, after the passage of the selective service act, it drafted 2.8\\xa0million men, and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to france every day. in 1917, the us congress granted us citizenship to puerto ricans to allow them to be drafted to participate in world wari, as part of the jones–shafroth act. german general staff assumptions that it would be able to defeat the british and french forces before american troops reinforced them were proven incorrect.\\n\\nthe united states navy sent a battleship group to scapa flow to join with the british grand fleet, destroyers to queenstown, ireland, and submarines to help guard convoys. several regiments of us marines were also dispatched to france. the british and french wanted american units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. general john j. pershing, american expeditionary forces (aef) commander, refused to break up american units to be used as filler material. as an exception, he did allow african-american combat regiments to be used in french divisions. the harlem hellfighters fought as part of the french 16th division, and earned a unit croix de guerre for their actions at château-thierry, belleau wood, and sechault. aef doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by british empire and french commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.\\n\\ngerman spring offensive of 1918.ludendorff drew up plans (codenamed operation michael) for the 1918 offensive on the western front. the spring offensive sought to divide the british and french forces with a series of feints and advances. the german leadership hoped to end the war before significant us forces arrived. the operation commenced on 21 march 1918 with an attack on british forces near saint-quentin. german forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 km.\\n\\nbritish and french trenches were penetrated using novel infiltration tactics, also named hutier tactics after general oskar von hutier, by specially trained units called stormtroopers. previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. in the spring offensive of 1918, however, ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. they attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. more heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. this german success relied greatly on the element of surprise.\\n\\nthe front moved to within 120 km of paris. three heavy krupp railway guns fired 183\\xa0shells on the capital, causing many parisians to flee. the initial offensive was so successful that kaiser wilhelm ii declared 24 march a national holiday. many germans thought victory was near. after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the germans were unable to consolidate their gains. the problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.\\n\\ngeneral foch pressed to use the arriving american troops as individual replacements, whereas pershing sought to field american units as an independent force. these units were assigned to the depleted french and british empire commands on 28 march. a supreme war council of allied forces was created at the doullens conference on 5november 1917. general foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. haig, petain, and pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the british, french, and us commands operated largely independently.\\n\\nfollowing operation michael, germany launched operation georgette against the northern english channel ports. the allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by germany. the german army to the south then conducted operations blücher and yorck, pushing broadly towards paris. germany launched operation marne (second battle of the marne) on 15 july, in an attempt to encircle reims. the resulting counter-attack, which started the hundred days offensive, marked the first successful allied offensive of the war. by 20 july, the germans had retreated across the marne to their starting lines, having achieved little, and the german army never regained the initiative. german casualties between march and april 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.\\n\\nmeanwhile, germany was falling apart at home. anti-war marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. industrial output was half the 1913 levels.\\n\\nnew states enter the war.in the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the south caucasus: the first republic of armenia, the azerbaijan democratic republic, and the democratic republic of georgia, which declared their independence from the russian empire. two other minor entities were established, the centrocaspian dictatorship and south west caucasian republic (the former was liquidated by azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint armenian-british task force in early 1919). with the withdrawal of the russian armies from the caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. solidarity was briefly maintained when the transcaucasian federative republic was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in may, when the georgians asked for and received protection from germany and the azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the ottoman empire that was more akin to a military alliance. armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the ottoman turks before defeating them at the battle of sardarabad.\\n\\nhundred days offensive.the allied counteroffensive, known as the hundred days offensive, began on 8august 1918, with the battle of amiens. the battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 british, dominion, and french troops, and by the end of its first day a gap 24 km long had been created in the german lines. the defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing ludendorff to refer to this day as the \"black day of the german army\". after an advance as far as 23 km, german resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 august.\\n\\nrather than continuing the amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the allies shifted attention elsewhere. allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. they began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.\\n\\nthe day after the offensive began, ludendorff said: \"we cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.\" on 11 august he offered his resignation to the kaiser, who refused it, replying, \"i see that we must strike a balance. we have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. the war must be ended.\" on 13 august, at spa, hindenburg, ludendorff, the chancellor, and foreign minister hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the german crown council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. austria and hungary warned that they could continue the war only until december, and ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. prince rupprecht warned prince max of baden: \"our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that i no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier.\"\\n\\nbattle of albert.british and dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the battle of albert on 21 august. the assault was widened by french and then further british forces in the following days. during the last week of august the allied pressure along a 110 km front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. from german accounts, \"each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines.\"\\n\\nfaced with these advances, on 2 september the german supreme army command issued orders to withdraw in the south to the hindenburg line. this ceded without a fight the salient seized the previous april. according to ludendorff, \"we had to admit the necessity\\xa0... to withdraw the entire front from the scarpe to the vesle. in nearly four weeks of fighting beginning on 8august, over 100,000 german prisoners were taken. the german high command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. on 10 september hindenburg urged peace moves to emperor charles of austria, and germany appealed to the netherlands for mediation. on 14 september austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 september germany made a peace offer to belgium. both peace offers were rejected.\\n\\nallied advance to the hindenburg line.in september the allies advanced to the hindenburg line in the north and centre. the germans continued to fight strong rear-guard actions and launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the line continued to fall, with the bef alone taking 30,441\\xa0prisoners in the last week of september. on 24 september an assault by both the british and french came within 3 km of st. quentin. the germans had now retreated to positions along or behind the hindenburg line. that same day, supreme army command informed the leaders in berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.\\n\\nthe final assault on the hindenburg line began with the meuse-argonne offensive, launched by french and american troops on 26 september. the following week, co-operating french and american units broke through in champagne at the battle of blanc mont ridge, forcing the germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the belgian frontier. on 8october the line was pierced again by british and dominion troops at the battle of cambrai. the german army had to shorten its front and use the dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions as it fell back towards germany.\\n\\nwhen bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 september, ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. it was evident that germany could no longer mount a successful defence. the collapse of the balkans meant that germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. its reserves had been used up, even as us troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day. the americans supplied more than 80% of allied oil during the war, and there was no shortage.\\n\\ngerman revolution 1918–1919.news of germany\\'s impending military defeat spread throughout the german armed forces. the threat of mutiny was rife. admiral reinhard scheer and ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the \"valour\" of the german navy.\\n\\nin northern germany, the german revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of october 1918. units of the german navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. the sailors\\' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of wilhelmshaven and kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9november 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii, and to german surrender.\\n\\nnew german government surrenders.with the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, germany moved towards surrender. prince maximilian of baden took charge of a new government on 3october as chancellor of germany to negotiate with the allies. negotiations with president wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the british and french. wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the german military. there was no resistance when the social democrat philipp scheidemann on 9november declared germany to be a republic. the kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and wilhelm fled to exile in the netherlands. imperial germany was dead; a new germany had been born as the weimar republic.\\n\\narmistices and capitulations.the collapse of the central powers came swiftly. bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918. german emperor wilhelm ii in his telegram to bulgarian tsar ferdinand i described situation: “disgraceful! 62,000 serbs decided the war!\". on 29 september 1918, the german supreme army command informed kaiser wilhelm ii and the imperial chancellor count georg von hertling, that the military situation facing germany was hopeless .\\n\\non 30 october, the ottoman empire capitulated, signing the armistice of mudros.\\n\\non 24 october, the italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the battle of caporetto. this culminated in the battle of vittorio veneto, which marked the end of the austro-hungarian army as an effective fighting force. the offensive also triggered the disintegration of the austro-hungarian empire. during the last week of october, declarations of independence were made in budapest, prague, and zagreb. on 29 october, the imperial authorities asked italy for an armistice, but the italians continued advancing, reaching trento, udine, and trieste. on 3november, austria-hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an armistice (armistice of villa giusti). the terms, arranged by telegraph with the allied authorities in paris, were communicated to the austrian commander and accepted. the armistice with austria was signed in the villa giusti, near padua, on 3november. austria and hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the habsburg monarchy. in the following days the italian army occupied innsbruck and all tyrol with over 20,000 soldiers.\\n\\non 11 november, at 5:00 am, an armistice with germany was signed in a railroad carriage at compiègne. at 11\\xa0am on 11 november 1918—\"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\"—a ceasefire came into effect. during the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the western front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. the occupation of the rhineland took place following the armistice. the occupying armies consisted of american, belgian, british and french forces.\\n\\nin november 1918, the allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade germany. yet at the time of the armistice, no allied force had crossed the german frontier, the western front was still some 720 km from berlin, and the kaiser\\'s armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. these factors enabled hindenburg and other senior german leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. this resulted in the stab-in-the-back legend, which attributed germany\\'s defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic and unfit to fight), but to the public\\'s failure to respond to its \"patriotic calling\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by jews, socialists, and bolsheviks.\\n\\nthe allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. one estimate (using 1913 us dollars) is that the allies spent $58\\xa0billion on the war and the central powers only $25\\xa0billion. among the allies, the uk spent $21\\xa0billion and the us$17\\xa0billion; among the central powers germany spent $20\\xa0billion.\\n\\naftermath.in the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the german, austro-hungarian, ottoman, and russian. numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the romanovs, the hohenzollerns, the habsburgs, and the ottomans. belgium and serbia were badly damaged, as was france, with 1.4\\xa0million soldiers dead, not counting other casualties. germany and russia were similarly affected.\\n\\nformal end of the war.a formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the treaty of versailles with germany on 28 june 1919. the united states senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it, and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the knox–porter resolution was signed on 2july 1921 by president warren g. harding. for the united kingdom and the british empire, the state of war ceased under the provisions of the termination of the present war (definition) act 1918 with respect to:\\n\\nafter the treaty of versailles, treaties with austria, hungary, bulgaria, and the ottoman empire were signed. however, the negotiation of the treaty with the ottoman empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the allied powers and the country that would shortly become the republic of turkey was not signed until 24 july 1923, at lausanne.\\n\\nsome war memorials date the end of the war as being when the versailles treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war\\'s end concentrate on the armistice of 11 november 1918. legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the treaty of lausanne, was signed. under its terms, the allied forces left constantinople on 23 august 1923.\\n\\npeace treaties and national boundaries.after the war, the paris peace conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the central powers officially ending the war. the 1919 treaty of versailles dealt with germany and, building on wilson\\'s 14th point, brought into being the league of nations on 28 june 1919.\\n\\nthe central powers had to acknowledge responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by\" their aggression. in the treaty of versailles, this statement was article 231. this article became known as the war guilt clause as the majority of germans felt humiliated and resentful. overall the germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the \"diktat of versailles\". german historian hagen schulze said the treaty placed germany \"under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated.\" belgian historian laurence van ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the versailles treaty in german politics in the 1920s and 1930s:\\nactive denial of war guilt in germany and german resentment at both reparations and continued allied occupation of the rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. the legend of the \"stab in the back\" and the wish to revise the \"versailles diktat\", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the german nation persisted at the heart of german politics. even a man of peace such as [gustav] stresemann publicly rejected german guilt. as for the nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the german nation into a spirit of revenge. like a fascist italy, nazi germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.\\n\\nmeanwhile, new nations liberated from german rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours. the peace conference required all the defeated powers to pay reparations for all the damage done to civilians. however, owing to economic difficulties and germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on germany.\\n\\naustria-hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including austria, hungary, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. transylvania was shifted from hungary to greater romania. the details were contained in the treaty of saint-germain and the treaty of trianon. as a result of the treaty of trianon, 3.3\\xa0million hungarians came under foreign rule. although the hungarians made up approximately 54% of the population of the pre-war kingdom of hungary (according to the 1910 census), only 32% of its territory was left to hungary. between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 hungarians fled former hungarian territories attached to romania, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia.\\n\\nthe russian empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the october revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of estonia, finland, latvia, lithuania, and poland were carved from it. romania took control of bessarabia in april 1918.\\n\\nthe ottoman empire disintegrated, with much of its levant territory awarded to various allied powers as protectorates. the turkish core in anatolia was reorganised as the republic of turkey. the ottoman empire was to be partitioned by the treaty of sèvres of 1920. this treaty was never ratified by the sultan and was rejected by the turkish national movement, leading to the victorious turkish war of independence and the much less stringent 1923 treaty of lausanne.\\n\\neven though a lot of countries had already made a peace treaty, there was one exception, andorra. andorra declared war on germany in august 1914, but, because it had a very small population, andorra had never sent any soldiers to the battlefield. because of that, andorra was not allowed to go to the treaty of versailles, so the country had not made a peace treaty with germany until 1958.\\nwhen andorra made the declaration of war, it had an army of 600 part-time militarymen, commanded by two officials.\\n\\nnational identities.after 123 years, poland re-emerged as an independent country. the kingdom of serbia and its dynasty, as a \"minor entente nation\" and the country with the most casualties per capita, became the backbone of a new multinational state, the kingdom of serbs, croats and slovenes, later renamed yugoslavia. czechoslovakia, combining the kingdom of bohemia with parts of the kingdom of hungary, became a new nation. russia became the soviet union and lost finland, estonia, lithuania, and latvia, which became independent countries. the ottoman empire was soon replaced by turkey and several other countries in the middle east.\\n\\nin the british empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. in australia and new zealand the battle of gallipoli became known as those nations\\' \"baptism of fire\". it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that australian troops fought as australians, not just subjects of the british crown. anzac day, commemorating the australian and new zealand army corps (anzac), celebrates this defining moment.\\n\\nafter the battle of vimy ridge, where the canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps, canadians began to refer to their country as a nation \"forged from fire\". having succeeded on the same battleground where the \"mother countries\" had previously faltered, they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments. canada entered the war as a dominion of the british empire and remained so, although it emerged with a greater measure of independence. when britain declared war in 1914, the dominions were automatically at war; at the conclusion, canada, australia, new zealand, and south africa were individual signatories of the treaty of versailles.\\n\\nlobbying by chaim weizmann and fear that american jews would encourage the united states to support germany culminated in the british government\\'s balfour declaration of 1917, endorsing creation of a jewish homeland in palestine. a total of more than 1,172,000 jewish soldiers served in the allied and central power forces in world wari, including 275,000 in austria-hungary and 450,000 in tsarist russia.\\n\\nthe establishment of the modern state of israel and the roots of the continuing israeli–palestinian conflict are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the middle east that resulted from world wari. before the end of the war, the ottoman empire had maintained a modest level of peace and stability throughout the middle east. with the fall of the ottoman government, power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge. the political boundaries drawn by the victors of world wari were quickly imposed, sometimes after only cursory consultation with the local population. these continue to be problematic in the 21st-century struggles for national identity. while the dissolution of the ottoman empire at the end of world wari was pivotal in contributing to the modern political situation of the middle east, including the arab-israeli conflict, the end of ottoman rule also spawned lesser known disputes over water and other natural resources.\\n\\nthe prestige of germany and german things in latin america remained high after the war but did not recovered to its pre-war levels. indeed, in chile the war bought an end to a period of intense scientific and cultural influence writer eduardo de la barra scorningly called \"the german bewichment\" ().\\n\\nhealth effects.of the 60\\xa0million european military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8\\xa0million were killed, 7\\xa0million were permanently disabled, and 15\\xa0million were seriously injured. germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, austria-hungary lost 17.1%, and france lost 10.5%. in germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. by the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000\\xa0people in lebanon. between 5and 10 million people died in the russian famine of 1921. by 1922, there were between 4.5\\xa0million and 7million homeless children in russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from world wari, the russian civil war, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922. numerous anti-soviet russians fled the country after the revolution; by the 1930s, the northern chinese city of harbin had 100,000\\xa0russians. thousands more emigrated to france, england, and the united states.\\n\\nthe australian prime minister, billy hughes, wrote to the british prime minister, lloyd george, \"you have assured us that you cannot get better terms. i much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the british empire and her allies.\" australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were £831,280,947. of about 416,000 australians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.\\n\\ndiseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. in 1914 alone, louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in serbia. from 1918 to 1922, russia had about 25\\xa0million infections and 3million deaths from epidemic typhus. in 1923, 13 million russians contracted malaria, a sharp increase from the pre-war years. in addition, a major influenza epidemic spread around the world. overall, the 1918 flu pandemic killed at least 50 million people. moreover, between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world affecting nearly five million people.\\n\\nthe social disruption and widespread violence of the russian revolution of 1917 and the ensuing russian civil war sparked more than 2,000 pogroms in the former russian empire, mostly in ukraine. an estimated 60,000–200,000\\xa0civilian jews were killed in the atrocities.\\n\\nin the aftermath of world war i, greece fought against turkish nationalists led by mustafa kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the treaty of lausanne. according to various sources, several hundred thousand greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the greek genocide.\\n\\nground warfare.world war i began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. by the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and aircraft. infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior nco, were favoured.\\n\\nartillery also underwent a revolution. in 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. by 1917, indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone. counter-battery missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.\\n\\ngermany was far ahead of the allies in using heavy indirect fire. the german army employed 150 mm and 210 mm howitzers in 1914, when typical french and british guns were only 75 mm and 105 mm. the british had a 6-inch (152\\xa0mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. the germans also fielded austrian 305 mm and 420 mm guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of minenwerfer, which were ideally suited for trench warfare.\\n\\non 27 june 1917 the germans used the biggest gun in the world, batterie pommern, nicknamed \"lange max\". this gun from krupp was able to shoot 750\\xa0kg shells from koekelare to dunkirk, a distance of about 50 km.\\n\\nmuch of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during world wari. such battles include ypres, the marne, cambrai, the somme, verdun, and gallipoli. the germans employed the haber process of nitrogen fixation to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the british naval blockade. artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties and consumed vast quantities of explosives. the large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and fragmentation forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the french, who introduced the adrian helmet in 1915. it was quickly followed by the brodie helmet, worn by british imperial and us troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive german stahlhelm, a design, with improvements, still in use today.\\n\\nthe widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. gases used included chlorine, mustard gas and phosgene. relatively few war casualties were caused by gas, as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as gas masks. the use of chemical warfare and small-scale strategic bombing (as opposed to tactical bombing) were both outlawed by the hague conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness, though they captured the public imagination.\\n\\nthe most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece. the german version were nicknamed big berthas, even though the namesake was not a railway gun. germany developed the paris gun, able to bombard paris from over 100 km, though shells were relatively light at 94\\xa0kilograms (210\\xa0lb).\\n\\ntrenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation shells helped bring the battle lines of world wari to a stalemate. the british and the french sought a solution with the creation of the tank and mechanised warfare. the british first tanks were used during the battle of the somme on 15 september 1916. mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. within a year, the british were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the battle of cambrai in november 1917, by breaking the hindenburg line, while combined arms teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100\\xa0guns. meanwhile, the french introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the renault ft, which became a decisive tool of the victory. the conflict also saw the introduction of light automatic weapons and submachine guns, such as the lewis gun, the browning automatic rifle, and the bergmann mp18.\\n\\nanother new weapon, the flamethrower, was first used by the german army and later adopted by other forces. although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.\\n\\ntrench railways evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.\\n\\nareas taken in major attacks.on the western front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at verdun, the somme, passchendaele, and cambrai the exception was nivelle\\'s offensive in which the german defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the french army. in 1918 the germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: michael, on the lys, and on the aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. the allies struck back at soissons, which showed the germans that they must return to the defensive, and at amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at cambrai.\\n\\nthe areas in the east were larger. the germans did well at the first masurian lakes driving the invaders from east prussia, and at riga, which led the russians to sue for peace. the austro-hungarians and germans joined for a great success at gorlice–tarnów, which drove the russians out of poland. in a series of attacks along with the bulgarians they occupied serbia, albania, montenegro and most of romania. the allies successes came later in palestine, the beginning of the end for the ottomans, in macedonia, which drove the bulgarians out of the war, and at vittorio veneto, the final blow for the austro-hungarians. the area occupied in east by the central powers on 11 november 1918 was 1042600 km2.\\n\\nnaval.germany deployed u-boats (submarines) after the war began. alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the atlantic, the kaiserliche marine employed them to deprive the british isles of vital supplies. the deaths of british merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of u-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive sonar, 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines (hms r-1, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918). to extend their operations, the germans proposed supply submarines (1916). most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until world warii revived the need.\\n\\naviation.fixed-wing aircraft were first used militarily by the italians in libya on 23 october 1911 during the italo-turkish war for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and aerial photography the next year. by 1914, their military utility was obvious. they were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. to shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. strategic bombers were created, principally by the germans and british, though the former used zeppelins as well. towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a raid to destroy the zeppelin hangars at tondern in 1918.\\n\\nmanned observation balloons, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with parachutes, so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. at the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the british leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.\\n\\nrecognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. to defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. the germans conducted air raids on england during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage british morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from france.\\n\\nbaralong incidents.on 19 august 1915, the german submarine u-27 was sunk by the british q-ship . all german survivors were summarily executed by baralongs crew on the orders of lieutenant godfrey herbert, the captain of the ship. the shooting was reported to the media by american citizens who were on board the nicosia, a british freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by u-27 just minutes before the incident.\\n\\non 24 september, baralong destroyed u-41, which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship urbino. according to karl goetz, the submarine\\'s commander, baralong continued to fly the us flag after firing on u-41 and then rammed the lifeboat—carrying the german survivors—sinking it.\\n\\ntorpedoing of hmhs llandovery castle.the canadian hospital ship was torpedoed by the german submarine sm u-86 on 27 june 1918 in violation of international law. only 24 of the 258 medical personnel, patients, and crew survived. survivors reported that the u-boat surfaced and ran down the lifeboats, machine-gunning survivors in the water. the u-boat captain, helmut patzig, was charged with war crimes in germany following the war, but escaped prosecution by going to the free city of danzig, beyond the jurisdiction of german courts.\\n\\nblockade of germany.after the war, the german government claimed that approximately 763,000 german civilians died from starvation and disease during the war because of the allied blockade. an academic study done in 1928 put the death toll at 424,000. germany protested that the allies had used starvation as a weapon of war. sally marks argued that the german accounts of a hunger blockade are a \"myth,\" as germany did not face the starvation level of belgium and the regions of poland and northern france that it occupied. according to the british judge and legal philosopher patrick devlin, \"the war orders given by the admiralty on 26 august [1914] were clear enough. all food consigned to germany through neutral ports was to be captured and all food consigned to rotterdam was to be presumed consigned to germany.\\xa0... the british were determined on the starvation policy, whether or not it was lawful.\"\\n\\nchemical weapons in warfare.the german army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the second battle of ypres (22 april – 25 may 1915), after german scientists working under the direction of fritz haber at the kaiser wilhelm institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine. the use of chemical weapons was sanctioned by the german high command in an effort to force allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons. in time, chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately 1.3\\xa0million casualties, but relatively few fatalities: about 90,000 in total. for example, there were an estimated 186,000 british chemical weapons casualties during the war (80% of which were the result of exposure to the vesicant sulfur mustard, introduced to the battlefield by the germans in july 1917, which burns the skin at any point of contact and inflicts more severe lung damage than chlorine or phosgene), and up to one-third of american casualties were caused by them. the russian army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in world wari. the use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the 1907 hague convention on land warfare, which prohibited their use.\\n\\nthe effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. in addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. an estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. british field marshal sir douglas haig wrote in his diary, \"my officers and i were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. however, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all.\"\\n\\nthe war damaged chemistry\\'s prestige in european societies, in particular the german variety.\\n\\nottoman empire.the ethnic cleansing of the ottoman empire\\'s armenian population, including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of the ottoman empire is considered genocide. the ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the armenian population at the beginning of the war and portrayed deliberately provoked acts of armenian resistance as rebellions to justify further extermination. in early 1915, a number of armenians volunteered to join the russian forces and the ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the tehcir law (law on deportation), which authorised the deportation of armenians from the empire\\'s eastern provinces to syria between 1915 and 1918. the armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by ottoman brigands. while an exact number of deaths is unknown, the international association of genocide scholars estimates 1.5\\xa0million. the government of turkey has consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during world wari; these claims are rejected by most historians.\\n\\nother ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the ottoman empire during this period, including assyrians and greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. at least 250,000 assyrian christians, about half of the population, and 350,000–750,000 anatolian and pontic greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922.\\n\\nrussian empire.many pogroms accompanied the russian revolution of 1917 and the ensuing russian civil war. 60,000–200,000 civilian jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former russian empire (mostly within the pale of settlement in present-day ukraine). there were an estimated 7–12 million casualties during the russian civil war, mostly civilians.\\n\\nrape of belgium.the german invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. in addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential francs-tireurs (guerrillas) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. the german army executed over 6,500 french and belgian civilians between august and november 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior german officers. the german army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at louvain—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. over half the german regiments in belgium were involved in major incidents. thousands of workers were shipped to germany to work in factories. british propaganda dramatising the rape of belgium attracted much attention in the united states, while berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because of the threat of franc-tireurs like those in france in 1870. the british and french magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the united states, where they played a major role in dissolving support for germany.\\n\\nsoldiers\\' experiences.the british soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were conscripted into service. surviving veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their experiences only amongst themselves. grouping together, they formed \"veterans\\' associations\" or \"legions\". a small number of personal accounts of american veterans have been collected by the library of congress veterans history project.\\n\\nprisoners of war.about eight million men surrendered and were held in pow camps during the war. all nations pledged to follow the hague conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for pows was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front. individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered en masse. at the siege of maubeuge about 40,000 french soldiers surrendered, at the battle of galicia russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 austrian captives, at the brusilov offensive about 325,000 to 417,000 germans and austrians surrendered to russians, and at the battle of tannenberg 92,000 russians surrendered. when the besieged garrison of kaunas surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 russians became prisoners, at the battle near przasnysz (february–march 1915) 14,000 germans surrendered to russians, and at the first battle of the marne about 12,000 germans surrendered to the allies. 25–31% of russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for austria-hungary 32%, for italy 26%, for france 12%, for germany 9%; for britain 7%. prisoners from the allied armies totalled about 1.4\\xa0million (not including russia, which lost 2.5–3.5\\xa0million men as prisoners). from the central powers about 3.3\\xa0million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to russians. germany held 2.5\\xa0million prisoners; russia held 2.2–2.9\\xa0million; while britain and france held about 720,000. most were captured just before the armistice. the united states held 48,000. the most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down. once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in world warii), thanks in part to the efforts of the international red cross and inspections by neutral nations. however, conditions were terrible in russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in russia died, and in central powers imprisonment 8% of russians. in germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.\\nthe ottoman empire often treated pows poorly. some 11,800 british empire soldiers, most of them indians, became prisoners after the siege of kut in mesopotamia in april 1916; 4,250 died in captivity. although many were in a poor condition when captured, ottoman officers forced them to march 1100 km to anatolia. a survivor said: \"we were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die.\" the survivors were then forced to build a railway through the taurus mountains.\\n\\nin russia, when the prisoners from the czech legion of the austro-hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the russian civil war.\\n\\nwhile the allied prisoners of the central powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to central power prisoners of the allies and russia, many of whom served as forced labour, e.g., in france until 1920. they were released only after many approaches by the red cross to the allied supreme council. german prisoners were still being held in russia as late as 1924.\\n\\nmilitary attachés and war correspondents.military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern \"embedded\" positions within the opposing land and naval forces.\\n\\nsupport for the war.in the balkans, yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, ante trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of yugoslavs from austria-hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent yugoslavia. the yugoslav committee, led by trumbić, was formed in paris on 30 april 1915 but shortly moved its office to london. in april 1918, the rome congress of oppressed nationalities met, including czechoslovak, italian, polish, transylvanian, and yugoslav representatives who urged the allies to support national self-determination for the peoples residing within austria-hungary.\\n\\nin the middle east, arab nationalism soared in ottoman territories in response to the rise of turkish nationalism during the war, with arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-arab state. in 1916, the arab revolt began in ottoman-controlled territories of the middle east in an effort to achieve independence.\\n\\nin east africa, iyasu v of ethiopia was supporting the dervish state who were at war with the british in the somaliland campaign. von syburg, the german envoy in addis ababa, said, \"now the time has come for ethiopia to regain the coast of the red sea driving the italians home, to restore the empire to its ancient size.\" the ethiopian empire was on the verge of entering world wari on the side of the central powers before iyasu\\'s overthrow due to allied pressure on the ethiopian aristocracy. iyasu was accused of converting to islam. according to ethiopian historian bahru zewde, the evidence used to prove iyasu\\'s conversion was a doctored photo of iyasu wearing a turban provided by the allies. some historians claim the british spy t. e. lawrence forged the iyasu photo.\\n\\na number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in august 1914. but european socialists split on national lines, with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for the war. once the war began, austrian, british, french, german, and russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries\\' intervention in the war.\\n\\nitalian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. one of the most prominent and popular italian nationalist supporters of the war was gabriele d\\'annunzio, who promoted italian irredentism and helped sway the italian public to support intervention in the war. the italian liberal party, under the leadership of paolo boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the allies and used the dante alighieri society to promote italian nationalism. italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including benito mussolini and leonida bissolati. however, the italian socialist party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a general strike called red week. the italian socialist party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including mussolini. mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on italian-populated regions of austria-hungary, formed the pro-interventionist il popolo d\\'italia and the fasci rivoluzionario d\\'azione internazionalista (\"revolutionary fasci for international action\") in october 1914 that later developed into the fasci di combattimento in 1919, the origin of fascism. mussolini\\'s nationalism enabled him to raise funds from ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create il popolo d\\'italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.\\n\\nopposition to the war.once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. among the exceptions were the bolsheviks, the socialist party of america, the italian socialist party, and people like karl liebknecht, rosa luxemburg, and their followers in germany.\\n\\nbenedict xv, elected to the papacy less than three months into world wari, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. in stark contrast to his predecessor, five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. his first encyclical, ad beatissimi apostolorum, given 1november 1914, was concerned with this subject. benedict xv found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers. the 1915 treaty of london between italy and the triple entente included secret provisions whereby the allies agreed with italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the central powers. consequently, the publication of benedict\\'s proposed of august 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except austria-hungary.\\n\\nin britain in 1914, the public schools officers\\' training corps annual camp was held at tidworth pennings, near salisbury plain. head of the british army, lord kitchener, was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war prevented him. general horace smith-dorrien was sent instead. he surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of donald christopher smith, a bermudian cadet who was present),\\nthat war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. in our ignorance i, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a british general who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the general\\'s prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.\\nvoicing these sentiments did not hinder smith-dorrien\\'s career, or prevent him from doing his duty in world wari to the best of his abilities.\\n\\nmany countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. these included eugene debs in the united states and bertrand russell in britain. in the us, the espionage act of 1917 and sedition act of 1918 made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed \"disloyal\". publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors, and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.\\n\\na number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. although the vast majority of irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced irish nationalists staunchly opposed taking part. the war began amid the home rule crisis in ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by july 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in ireland. irish nationalists and marxists attempted to pursue irish independence, culminating in the easter rising of 1916, with germany sending 20,000 rifles to ireland to stir unrest in britain. the uk government placed ireland under martial law in response to the easter rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling. however, opposition to involvement in the war increased in ireland, resulting in the conscription crisis of 1918.\\n\\nother opposition came from conscientious objectors—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight. in britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status. some of them, most notably prominent peace activist stephen henry hobhouse, refused both military and alternative service. many suffered years of prison, including solitary confinement and bread and water diets. even after the war, in britain many job advertisements were marked \"no conscientious objectors need apply\".\\nthe central asian revolt started in the summer of 1916, when the russian empire government ended its exemption of muslims from military service.\\n\\nin 1917, a series of french army mutinies led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.\\n\\non 1–4 may 1917, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of petrograd, and after them, the workers and soldiers of other russian cities, led by the bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading \"down with the war!\" and \"all power to the soviets!\" the mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the russian provisional government. in milan, in may 1917, bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation. the italian army was forced to enter milan with tanks and machine guns to face bolsheviks and anarchists, who fought violently until 23 may when the army gained control of the city. almost 50 people (including three italian soldiers) were killed and over 800 people arrested.\\n\\nin september 1917, russian soldiers in france began questioning why they were fighting for the french at all and mutinied. in russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the october revolution of 1917, with the call going up for \"bread, land, and peace\". the decree on peace, written by vladimir lenin, was passed on 8november 1917, following the success of the october revolution. the bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with germany, the peace of brest-litovsk, despite its harsh conditions. the german revolution of 1918-1919 led to the abdication of the kaiser and german surrender.\\n\\nconscription.conscription was common in most european countries. however, it was controversial in english-speaking countries. it was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the irish catholics in ireland and australia, and the french catholics in canada.\\n\\ncanada.in canada the issue produced a major political crisis that permanently alienated the francophones. it opened a political gap between french canadians, who believed their true loyalty was to canada and not to the british empire, and members of the anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to their british heritage.\\n\\naustralia.australia had a form of conscription at the outbreak of the war, as compulsory military training had been introduced in 1911. however, the defence act 1903 provided that unexempted males could be called upon only for home defence during times of war, not overseas service. prime minister billy hughes wished to amend the legislation to require conscripts to serve overseas, and held two non-binding referendums – one in 1916 and one in 1917 – in order to secure public support. both were defeated by narrow margins, with farmers, the labour movement, the catholic church, and irish-australians combining to campaign for the \"no\" vote. the issue of conscription caused the 1916 australian labor party split. hughes and his supporters were expelled from the party, forming the national labor party and then the nationalist party. despite the referendum results, the nationalists won a landslide victory at the 1917 federal election.\\n\\nbritain.in britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in britain—six of ten million eligible. of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. conscription during the first world war began when the british government passed the military service act in 1916. the act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. there was a system of military service tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. the law went through several changes before the war ended. married men were exempt in the original act, although this was changed in june 1916. the age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy. conscription lasted until mid-1919. due to the political situation in ireland, conscription was never applied there; only in england, scotland and wales.\\n\\nunited states.in the united states, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. the administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1million target in the first six weeks of the war. in 1917 10 million men were registered. this was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3million inducted into the military services. the draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. in all 367,710 black americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).\\n\\nforms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. the most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". the most famous was eugene debs, head of the socialist party of america, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. in 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the thirteenth amendment\\'s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. the supreme court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the selective draft law cases on 7january 1918.\\n\\naustria-hungary.like all the armies of mainland europe, austria-hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. the effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic germans. this was much resented. the army has been described as being \"run on colonial lines\" and the slav soldiers as \"disaffected\". thus conscription contributed greatly to austria\\'s disastrous performance on the battlefield.\\n\\ndiplomacy.the non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. for the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (italy, ottoman empire, bulgaria, romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the central powers, especially among czechs, poles, and arabs. in addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.\\n\\nlegacy and memory.the first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway, more than a century later.\\n\\nhistoriography.historian heather jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: why the war began, why the allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.\\n\\nmemorials.memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the commonwealth war graves commission, the american battle monuments commission, the german war graves commission, and le souvenir français. many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the menin gate memorial and the thiepval memorial to the missing of the somme.\\n\\nin 1915 john mccrae, a canadian army doctor, wrote the poem in flanders fields as a salute to those who perished in the great war. published in punch on 8december 1915, it is still recited today, especially on remembrance day and memorial day.\\n\\nnational world war i museum and memorial in kansas city, missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in world wari. the liberty memorial was dedicated on 1november 1921, when the supreme allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people.\\n\\nthe uk government has budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018. the lead body is the imperial war museum. on 3august 2014, french president francois hollande and german president joachim gauck together marked the centenary of germany\\'s declaration of war on france by laying the first stone of a memorial in vieil armand, known in german as hartmannswillerkopf, for french and german soldiers killed in the war.\\n\\ncultural memory.world war i had a lasting impact on social memory. it was seen by many in britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the victorian period, and across europe many regarded it as a watershed. historian samuel hynes explained:\\n\\nthis has become the most common perception of world war i, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. films such as all quiet on the western front, paths of glory and king & country have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including camrades, poppies of flanders, and shoulder arms indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive. likewise, the art of paul nash, john nash, christopher nevinson, and henry tonks in britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as muirhead bone painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate. several historians like john terraine, niall ferguson and gary sheffield have challenged these interpretations as partial and polemical views:\\n\\nthese beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. in every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. in recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of world wari. it has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. the many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. the war is not now seen as a \\'fight about nothing\\', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. it has been acknowledged that british generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the british army played a major part in the defeat of the germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.\\n\\nthough these views have been discounted as \"myths\", they are common. they have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as \"aimless\" following the contrasting second world war and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. the majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.\\n\\nsocial trauma.the social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.\\n\\nthe optimism of la belle époque was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the lost generation. for years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict\\'s growing mythological status. though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. such historians as dan todman, paul fussell, and samuel heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.\\n\\ndiscontent in germany.the rise of nazism and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. similarly, the popularity of the stab-in-the-back legend (german: dolchstoßlegende) was a testament to the psychological state of defeated germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. this conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the german populace came to see themselves as victims. the widespread acceptance of the \"stab-in-the-back\" theory delegitimised the weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.\\n\\ncommunist and fascist movements around europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. these feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. adolf hitler was able to gain popularity by using german discontent with the still controversial treaty of versailles. world warii was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by world wari. furthermore, it was common for germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of world wari. american historian william rubinstein wrote that:\\n\\nthe \\'age of totalitarianism\\' included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the jewish holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the communist world, other mass killings carried out by nazi germany and its allies, and also the armenian genocide of 1915. all these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern europe as a result of world wari, without which surely neither communism nor fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.\\n\\neconomic effects.one of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in britain, france, the united states, and the dominions of the british empire. to harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. new taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the war effort; many have lasted to this day. similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in austria-hungary and germany.\\n\\ngross domestic product (gdp) increased for three allies (britain, italy, and the united states), but decreased in france and russia, in neutral netherlands, and in the three main central powers. the shrinkage in gdp in austria, russia, france, and the ottoman empire ranged between 30% and 40%. in austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war\\'s end there was no meat.\\n\\nin all nations, the government\\'s share of gdp increased, surpassing 50% in both germany and france and nearly reaching that level in britain. to pay for purchases in the united states, britain cashed in its extensive investments in american railroads and then began borrowing heavily from wall street. president wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in us government lending to the allies. after 1919, the us demanded repayment of these loans. the repayments were, in part, funded by german reparations that, in turn, were supported by american loans to germany. this circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. britain still owed the united states $4.4 billion of world wari debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.\\n\\nmacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. families were altered by the departure of many men. with the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. at the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. this aided the struggle for voting rights for women.\\n\\nworld war i further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of surplus women. the deaths of nearly one million men during the war in britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. the number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. in addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. the war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.\\n\\nin britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. the new system worked smoothly. from 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.\\n\\nbritain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. geologists such as albert ernest kitson were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the african colonies. kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese, used in munitions production, in the gold coast.\\n\\narticle 231 of the treaty of versailles (the so-called \"war guilt\" clause) stated germany accepted responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of germany and her allies.\" it was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with austria and hungary. however neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt.\" in 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132\\xa0billion gold marks. however, \"allied experts knew that germany could not pay\" this sum. the total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being \"deliberately designed to be chimerical\" and its \"primary function was to mislead public opinion\\xa0... into believing the \"total sum was being maintained.\" thus, 50\\xa0billion gold marks (12.5\\xa0billion dollars) \"represented the actual allied assessment of german capacity to pay\" and \"therefore\\xa0... represented the total german reparations\" figure that had to be paid.\\n\\nthis figure could be paid in cash or in kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). in addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the library of louvain. by 1929, the great depression arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world. in 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point germany had paid only the equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations. with the rise of adolf hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. david andelman notes \"refusing to pay doesn\\'t make an agreement null and void. the bonds, the agreement, still exist.\" thus, following the second world war, at the london conference in 1953, germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. on 3october 2010, germany made the final payment on these bonds.\\n\\nthe war contributed to the evolution of the wristwatch from women\\'s jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the pocketwatch, which requires a free hand to operate. military funding of advancements in radio contributed to the postwar popularity of the medium.\\n\\nsee also.- lists of world war i

series produced by eon productions. it is based on the 1963 novel of the same name by ian fleming. following sean connery\\'s decision to retire from the role after you only live twice, eon productions selected an unknown actor and model, george lazenby, to play the part of james bond. during the making of the film, lazenby announced that he would play the role of bond only once.\\n\\nin the film, bond faces blofeld (telly savalas), who is planning to hold the world ransom by the threat of sterilising the world\\'s food supply through a group of brainwashed \"angels of death\". along the way bond meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries contessa teresa di vicenzo (diana rigg).\\n\\nit is the only bond film to have been directed by peter r. hunt, who had served as a film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. hunt, along with producers albert r. broccoli and harry saltzman, decided to produce a more realistic film that would follow the novel closely. it was shot in switzerland, england, and portugal from october 1968 to may 1969. although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor you only live twice, on her majesty\\'s secret service was still one of the top performing films of the year. critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film\\'s reputation has improved greatly over time.\\n\\nplot.james bond\\xa0– agent 007 – saves a woman on the beach from committing suicide by drowning, and later meets her again in a casino. the woman, contessa teresa \"tracy\" di vicenzo, invites bond to her hotel room to thank him, but when bond arrives he is attacked by an unidentified man. after subduing the man, bond returns to his own room and finds tracy there, who claims she didn\\'t know the attacker was there. the next morning, bond is kidnapped by several men, including the one he fought, who take him to meet marc-ange draco, the head of the european crime syndicate unione corse. draco reveals that tracy is his only daughter and tells bond of her troubled past, offering bond one million pounds if he will marry her. bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing tracy if draco reveals the whereabouts of ernst stavro blofeld, the head of spectre.\\n\\nbond returns to london, and after a brief argument with m at the british secret service headquarters, where bond tries to resign, heads for draco\\'s birthday party in portugal. there, bond and tracy begin a whirlwind romance, and draco directs the agent to a law firm in bern, switzerland. bond investigates the office of swiss lawyer gumbold, and learns that blofeld is corresponding with london college of arms\\' genealogist sir hilary bray, attempting to claim the title \\'count balthazar de bleuchamp\\'.\\n\\nposing as bray, bond goes to meet blofeld, who has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop piz gloria in the swiss alps. bond meets twelve young women, the \"angels of death\", who are patients at the institute\\'s clinic, apparently cured of their allergies. at night bond goes to the room of one patient, ruby, to seduce her. at midnight bond sees that the 12 ladies go into a sleep-induced hypnotic state while blofeld gives them audio instructions for when they return home. in fact, the women are being brainwashed to distribute bacteriological warfare agents throughout the world.\\n\\nbond tries to trick blofeld into leaving switzerland so that mi6 can arrest him without violating swiss sovereignty. blofeld refuses and bond is eventually caught by henchwoman irma bunt. blofeld reveals that he identified bond after his attempt to lure him out of switzerland, and tells his henchmen to take the agent away. bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down piz gloria while blofeld and his men give chase. arriving at the village of lauterbrunnen, bond finds tracy and they escape bunt and her men after a car chase. a blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where bond professes his love to tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. the next morning, as the flight resumes, blofeld sets off an avalanche; tracy is captured, while bond is buried but manages to escape.\\n\\nback in london at m\\'s office, bond is informed that blofeld intends to hold the world at ransom by threatening to destroy its agriculture using his brainwashed women, demanding amnesty for all past crimes, and that he be recognised as the current count de bleuchamp. m tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. bond then enlists draco and his forces to attack blofeld\\'s headquarters, while also rescuing tracy from blofeld\\'s captivity. the facility is destroyed, and blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with bond pursuing him. the chase ends when blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck. bond and tracy marry in portugal, then drive away in bond\\'s aston martin. when bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple\\'s car. bond survives, but tracy is killed in the attack.\\n\\ncast.- george lazenby as james

saltzman had originally intended to make on her majesty\\'s secret service after goldfinger and richard maibaum worked on a script at that time. however, thunderball was filmed instead after the ongoing rights dispute over the novel was settled between fleming and kevin mcclory. on her majesty\\'s secret service was due to follow that, but problems with a warm swiss winter and inadequate snow cover led to saltzman and broccoli postponing the film again, favouring production of you only live twice.\\n\\nbetween the resignation of sean connery at the beginning of filming you only live twice and its release, saltzman had planned to adapt the man with the golden gun in cambodia and use roger moore as the next bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and moore signed up for another series of the saint. after you only live twice was released in 1967, the producers once again picked up with on her majesty\\'s secret service.\\n\\npeter hunt, who had worked on the five preceding films, had impressed broccoli and saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series; it was also the result of a long-standing promise from broccoli and saltzman for a directorial position. hunt also asked for the position during the production of chitty chitty bang bang, and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer michael reed. hunt was focused on putting his mark – \"i wanted it to be different than any other bond film would be. it was my film, not anyone else\\'s.\" on her majesty\\'s secret service was the last film on which hunt worked in the series.\\n\\nwriting.screenwriter richard maibaum, who had worked on all the previous bond films bar you only live twice, was responsible for on her majesty\\'s secret services script. saltzman and broccoli decided to drop the science fiction gadgets from the earlier films and focus more on plot as in from russia with love. peter hunt asked simon raven to write some of the dialogue between tracy and blofeld in piz gloria, which was to be \"sharper, better and more intellectual\"; one of raven\\'s additions was having tracy quoting james elroy flecker. when writing the script, the producers decided to make the closest adaptation of the book possible: virtually everything in the novel occurs in the film and hunt was reported to always enter the set carrying an annotated copy of the novel.\\n\\nwith the script following the novel more closely than the other film adaptations of the eponymous source novels, there are several continuity errors due to the films taking place in a different order, such as blofeld not recognising bond, despite having met him face-to-face in the previous film you only live twice. in the original script, bond undergoes plastic surgery to disguise him from his enemies; the intention was to allow an unrecognisable bond to infiltrate blofeld\\'s hideout and help the audience accept the new actor in the role. however, this was dropped in favour of ignoring the change in actor.\\n\\nto make audiences not forget it was the same james bond, just played by another actor, the producers inserted many references to the previous films, some as in-jokes. these include bond breaking the fourth wall by stating \"this never happened to the other fellow\", the credits sequence with images from the previous installments, bond visiting his office and finding objects from dr. no, from russia with love and thunderball, and a caretaker whistling the theme from goldfinger. maibaum later said he thought \"lazenby was not ideal for the part\" but \"it was a marvelous script.\"\\n\\ncasting.in 1967, after five films, sean connery resigned from the role of james bond and—during the filming of you only live twice—was not on speaking terms with albert broccoli. the confirmed front runners were englishman john richardson, dutchman hans de vries, australian robert campbell, englishman anthony rogers and australian george lazenby.\\n\\nbroccoli and hunt eventually chose lazenby after seeing him in a fry\\'s chocolate cream advertisement. lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial bond elements such as a rolex submariner wristwatch and a savile row suit (ordered for, but uncollected by, connery), and going to connery\\'s barber at the dorchester hotel. broccoli noticed lazenby as a bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. the position was consolidated when lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing broccoli with his ability to display aggression. lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was convinced by his agent ronan o\\'rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, and as a result he left the series after the release of on her majesty\\'s secret service in 1969.\\n\\nfor tracy draco, the producers wanted an established actress opposite neophyte lazenby. brigitte bardot was invited, but after she signed to appear in shalako opposite sean connery, the deal fell through, and diana rigg—who had already been the popular heroine emma peel in the avengers—was cast instead. rigg said one of the reasons for accepting the role was that she always wanted to be in an epic film. telly savalas was cast following a suggestion from broccoli, and hunt\\'s neighbour george baker was offered the part of sir hilary bray. baker\\'s voice was also used when lazenby was impersonating bray, as hunt considered lazenby\\'s imitation not convincing enough. gabriele ferzetti was cast as draco after the producers saw him in we still kill the old way, but ferzetti\\'s heavy italian accent also led to his voice being redubbed by english actor david de keyser for the final cut.\\n\\nfilming.principal photography began in the canton of bern, switzerland, on 21 october 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of bond climbing the stairs of blofeld\\'s mountain retreat to meet the girls. the scenes were shot at the revolving restaurant piz gloria, located atop the schilthorn near the village of mürren. the location was found by production manager hubert fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in france and switzerland. the restaurant was still under construction, but the producers found the location interesting, and had to finance the provision of electricity and the aerial lift to make filming there possible. various chase scenes in the alps were shot at lauterbrunnen and saas-fee, while the christmas celebrations were filmed in grindelwald, and some scenes were shot on location in bern. production was hampered by weak snowfall which was unfavourable to the skiing action scenes. the producers even considered moving to another location in switzerland, but it was taken by the production of downhill racer. the swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. in march 1969, production moved to england, with london\\'s pinewood studios being used for interior shooting, and m\\'s house being shot in marlow, buckinghamshire. in april, the filmmakers went to portugal, where principal photography wrapped in may. the pre-credit coastal and hotel scenes were filmed at hotel estoril palacio in estoril and guincho beach, cascais, while lisbon was used for the reunion of bond and tracy, and the ending employed a mountain road in the arrábida national park near setúbal. harry saltzman wanted the portuguese scenes to be in france, but after searching there, peter hunt considered that not only were the locations not photogenic, but were already \"overexposed\".\\nwhile the first unit shot at piz gloria, the second unit, led by john glen, started filming the ski chases. the downhill skiing involved professional skiers, and various camera tricks. some cameras were handheld, with the operators holding them as they were going downhill with the stuntmen, and others were aerial, with cameramen johnny jordan – who had previously worked in the helicopter battle of you only live twice — developing a system where he was dangled by an 18 ft long parachute harness rig below a helicopter, allowing scenes to be shot on the move from any angle. the bobsledding chase was also filmed with the help of swiss olympic athletes, and was rewritten to incorporate the accidents the stuntmen suffered during shooting, such as the scene where bond falls from the sled. blofeld getting snared with a tree was performed at the studio by savalas himself, after the attempt to do this by the stuntman on location came out wrong. glen was also the editor of the film, employing a style similar to the one used by hunt in the previous bond films, with fast motion in the action scenes and exaggerated sound effects.\\n\\nthe avalanche scenes were due to be filmed in co-operation with the swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. the final result was a combination of a man-made avalanche at an isolated swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. the stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. for the scene where bond and tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. lazenby and rigg did most of the driving due to the high number of close-ups.\\nfor the cinematography, hunt aimed for a \"simple, but glamorous like the 1950s hollywood films i grew up with\", as well as something realistic, \"where the sets don\\'t look like sets\". cinematographer michael reed added he had difficulties with lighting, as every set built for the film had a ceiling, preventing spotlights from being hung from above. while shooting, hunt wanted \"the most interesting framings possible\", which would also look good after being cropped for television.\\n\\nlazenby said he experienced difficulties during shooting, not receiving any coaching despite his lack of acting experience, and with director hunt never addressing him directly, only through his assistant. lazenby also declared that hunt also asked the rest of the crew to keep a distance from him, as \"peter thought the more i was alone, the better i would be as james bond.\" allegedly, there also were personality conflicts with rigg, who was already an established star. however, according to director hunt, these rumours are untrue and there were no such difficulties—or else they were minor—and may have started with rigg joking to lazenby before filming a love scene \"hey george, i\\'m having garlic for lunch. i hope you are!\" hunt also declared that he usually had long talks with lazenby before and during shooting. for instance, to shoot tracy\\'s death scene, hunt brought lazenby to the set at 8 o\\'clock in the morning and made him rehearse all day long, \"and i broke him down until he was absolutely exhausted, and by the time we shot it at five o\\'clock, he was exhausted, and that\\'s how i got the performance.\" hunt said that if lazenby had remained in the role, he would also have directed the successor film, diamonds are forever, and that his original intentions were concluding the film with bond and tracy driving off following their wedding, saving tracy\\'s murder for the pre-credit sequence of diamonds are forever. the idea was discarded after lazenby quit the role.\\n\\non her majesty\\'s secret service was the longest bond film until casino royale was released in 2006. despite that, two scenes were deleted from the final print: irma bunt spying on bond as he buys a wedding ring for tracy, and a chase over london rooftops and into the royal mail underground rail system after bond\\'s conversation with sir hilary bray was overheard.\\n\\nmusic.the soundtrack for on her majesty\\'s secret service has been called \"perhaps the best score of the series.\" it was composed, arranged and conducted by john barry; it was his fifth successive bond film. barry opted to use more electrical instruments and a more aggressive sound in the music – \"i have to stick my oar in the musical area double strong to make the audience try and forget they don\\'t have sean\\xa0... to be bondian beyond bondian.\"\\n\\nbarry felt it would be difficult to compose a theme song containing the title \"on her majesty\\'s secret service\" unless it were written operatically, in the style of gilbert and sullivan. leslie bricusse had considered lyrics for the title song but director peter r. hunt allowed an instrumental title theme in the tradition of the first two bond films. the theme was described as \"one of the best title cuts, a wordless moog-driven monster, suitable for skiing at breakneck speed or dancing with equal abandon.\"\\n\\nbarry also composed the love song \"we have all the time in the world\", with lyrics by burt bacharach\\'s regular lyricist hal david, sung by louis armstrong. it is heard during the bond–tracy courtship montage, bridging draco\\'s birthday party in portugal and bond\\'s burglary of the gebrüder gumbold law office in bern, switzerland. barry recalled armstrong was very ill, but recorded the song in one take. armstrong did however make some further recordings in 1970 and 1971. the song was re-released in 1994, achieving the number three position during a 13-week spell in the uk charts. a hal david song entitled \"do you know how christmas trees are grown?\" performed by danish singer nina also featured in the film in several scenes.\\n\\nthe theme, \"on her majesty\\'s secret service\", is used in the film as an action theme alternative to monty norman\\'s \"james bond theme\", as with barry\\'s previous \"007\" themes. \"on her majesty\\'s secret service\" was covered in 1997 by the british big beat group, the propellerheads for the shaken and stirred album. barry-orchestrator nic raine recorded an arrangement of the escape from piz gloria sequence and it was featured as a theme in the trailers for the 2004 pixar animated film directed by brad bird, the incredibles.\\n\\nrelease and reception.on her majesty\\'s secret service was released on 18 december 1969 with its premiere at the odeon leicester square in london. lazenby appeared at the premiere with a beard, looking \"very un-bond-like\", according to the daily mirror. lazenby claimed the producers had tried to persuade him to shave it off to appear like bond, but at that stage he had already decided not to make another bond film and rejected the idea. the beard and accompanying shoulder-length hair \"strained his already fragile relationship with saltzman and broccoli\". as on her majesty\\'s secret service had been filmed in stereo, the first bond film to use the technology, the odeon had a new speaker system installed to benefit the new sounds.\\n\\nbecause lazenby had informed the producers that on her majesty\\'s secret service was to be his only outing as bond and because of the lack of gadgets used by bond in the film, few items of merchandise were produced for the film, apart from the soundtrack album and a film edition of the book. those that were produced included a number of corgi toys, including tracey\\'s cougar, campbell\\'s volkswagen and two versions of the bobsleigh—one with the 007 logo and one with the piz gloria logo. on her majesty\\'s secret service was nominated for only one award: george lazenby was nominated in the new star of the year – actor category at the 1970 golden globe award ceremony, losing out to jon voight.\\n\\nbox office.the film topped the north american box office when it opened with a gross of $1.2 million. the film closed its box office run with £750,000 in the united kingdom (the highest-grossing film of the year), $64.6 million worldwide, half of you only live twices total gross, but still one of the highest-grossing films of 1969. it was one of the most popular movies in france in 1969, with admissions of 1,958,172. nonetheless this was a considerable drop from you only live twice. after re-releases, the total box office was $82,000,000 worldwide.\\n\\ncontemporary reviews.the majority of reviews were critical of either the film, lazenby, or both, while most of the contemporary reviews in the british press referred to george lazenby at some point as \"the big fry\", a reference to his previous acting in fry\\'s chocolate advertisements. derek malcolm of the guardian was dismissive of lazenby\\'s performance, saying that he \"is not a good actor and though i never thought sean connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache.\" for all the criticism of lazenby, however, malcolm says that the film was \"quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion\". tom milne, writing in the observer was even more scathing, saying that \"i\\xa0... fervently trust (ohmss) will be the last of the james bond films. all the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new james bond strides without noticeable signs of animation.\"\\n\\ndonald zec in the daily mirror was equally damning of lazenby\\'s acting abilities, comparing him unfavourably to connery: \"he looks uncomfortably in the part like a size four foot in a size ten gumboot.\" zec was kinder to lazenby\\'s co-star, saying that \"there is style to diana rigg\\'s performance and i suspect that the last scene which draws something of a performance out of lazenby owes much to her silken expertise.\" a. h. weiler of the new york times also weighed in against lazenby, saying that \"lazenby, if not a spurious bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement.\"\\n\\none of the few supporters of lazenby amongst the critics was alexander walker in the london evening standard who said that \"the truth is that george lazenby is almost as good a james bond as the man referred to in his film as \\'the other fellow\\'. lazenby\\'s voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow\\'s twin on the shady side of the casino. bond is now definitely all set for the seventies.\" judith crist of new york also found the actor to be a strong point of the movie, stating that \"this time around there\\'s less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome mr. lazenby\".\\n\\nthe feminist film critic molly haskell also wrote an approving review of the film in the village voice: \"in a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it is nothing short of miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. i speak of the new and obsolete james bond, played by a man named george lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates.\" haskell was also affected by the film\\'s emotional ending: \"the love between bond and his tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. after ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. they drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. but they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. some of the audience hissed, i was shattered. if you like your bonds with happy endings, don\\'t go.\"\\n\\nretrospective reviews.modern reception to the film has been much more favorable. film critic james berardinelli summed this up in his review of the movie: \"with the exception of one production aspect, [it] is by far the best entry of the long-running james bond series. the film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, and a nice subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign from) her majesty\\'s secret service.\" lazenby is frequently quoted as the weakest bond, although connery, moore, dalton, and craig have rated his performance.\\n\\nthe american film reviewer leonard maltin has suggested that if it had been connery in the leading role instead of lazenby, on her majesty\\'s secret service would have epitomised the series. on the other hand, danny peary wrote, \"i\\'m not sure i agree with those who insist that if connery had played bond it would definitely be the best of the entire bond series\\xa0... connery\\'s bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. it actually works better with lazenby because he is incapable of playing bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn\\'t the looks\\xa0... lazenby\\'s bond also hasn\\'t the assurance of connery\\'s bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. he seems vulnerable and jittery at times. at the skating rink, he is actually scared. we worry about him\\xa0... on her majesty\\'s secret service doesn\\'t have connery and it\\'s impossible to ever fully adjust to lazenby, but i think that it still might be the best bond film, as many bond cultists claim.\" peary also described on her majesty\\'s secret service as \"the most serious\", \"the most cynical\" and \"the most tragic\" of the bond films.\\n\\nbrian fairbanks differed in his opinion of lazenby, saying that the film \"gives us a james bond capable of vulnerability, a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb.\" fairbanks also thought on her majesty\\'s secret service to be \"not only the best bond, it is also the last truly great film in the series. in fact, had the decision been made to end the series, this would have been the perfect final chapter.\"\\n\\nthe filmmaker steven soderbergh writes that \"for me there\\'s no question that cinematically on her majesty\\'s secret service is the best bond film and the only one worth watching repeatedly for reasons other than pure entertainment\\xa0... shot to shot, this movie is beautiful in a way none of the other bond films are\". the director christopher nolan also saw on her majesty\\'s secret service as his favourite bond film; in describing its influence on his own film, inception, nolan said, \"what i liked about it that we\\'ve tried to emulate in this film is there\\'s a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion.\"\\n\\nthe review-aggregation website rotten tomatoes gives the film a score of 81% based on 48 reviews, and a weighted average of 6.8 out of 10. the website\\'s critical consensus states, \"george lazenby\\'s only appearance as 007 is a fine entry in the series, featuring one of the most intriguing bond girls in tracy di vincenzo (diana rigg), breathtaking visuals, and some great ski chases.\" ign ranked on her majesty\\'s secret service as the eighth best bond film, entertainment weekly as the sixth, and norman wilner of msn, as the fifth best. digital spy listed the film as the best james bond film to date. the film also became a fan favourite, seeing \"ultimate success in the home video market\". in september 2012 it was announced that on her majesty\\'s secret service had topped a poll of bond fans run by 007 magazine to determine the greatest ever bond film. goldfinger came second in the poll and from russia with love was third.\\n\\nsee also.- outline of james bond\\n\\n\\nexternal

            "MAIN TEXT!!!! Brunt returned to first-team action after eight months out with an anterior cruciate knee injury in the 1–1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at The Hawthorns on 15 October 2016. He scored his first goal of the 2016–17 season on 3 December in a 3–1 home win over Watford, ending a run of 29 Premier League appearances without a goal. His second goal of the season came on 2 January 2017 in a 3–1 home victory against Hull City, when he headed in from a Matt Phillips corner kick. 12 days later, he made his 300th league appearance and 200th Premier League start for West Brom in the next fixture against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane which ended in a 4–0 defeat for the West Midlands club. On 9 February 2017, Brunt signed a contract extension which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2018 with an option for another year should he trigger a clause relating to appearances. He made his 500th career appearance in club football against Burnley in August 2017 and the following month made his 350th appearance for Albion, against Watford. Following the departure of Jonny Evans and Albion's relegation in 2018, new manager Darren Moore reinstated Brunt as club captain: he played 32 matches in the EFL Championship as the Baggies finished 4th, losing in the play-offs to local rivals Aston Villa. \n",

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'The Hawthorns', 'contents': 'the hawthorns is an all-seater football stadium in west bromwich, west midlands, england, with a capacity of 26,688. it has been the home of west bromwich albion f.c. since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. the hawthorns was the last football league ground to be built in the 19th century opening in september 1900, after construction work took only 4 months. at an altitude of 551 ft, it is the highest ground among those of all 92 premier league and football league clubs.\\n\\nprevious grounds.during the early years of the club, west bromwich albion led something of a nomadic existence, playing at five different grounds in a 22-year period. their first ground was cooper\\'s hill, which the club occupied from 1878 to 1879. from 1879 to 1881 they played at dartmouth park, although they may also have alternated between there and cooper\\'s hill during this period. albion\\'s third ground was bunn\\'s field, also known as the birches, where they played for a single season in 1881–82. with a capacity of 1500–2000, it was their first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. the increasing popularity of football led the well-established west bromwich dartmouth cricket club to rent their four acres ground to albion from 1882 to 1885, but they quickly outgrew their new home and soon needed to move again. albion\\'s tenure of stoney lane, from 1885 to 1900, was arguably the most successful period in the club\\'s history, as the club won the fa cup twice and were runners-up three times.\\n\\nhistory.the expiry of the lease on stoney lane, as well as the club\\'s desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. all of albion\\'s previous grounds had been close to the centre of west bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an \"out of town\" site on the borders of handsworth. the area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the hawthorns. the club signed a lease for the land on 14 may 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, sandwell park colliery, and albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in june 1913.\\n\\nwhen opened, the hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. the first match took place on monday 3 september 1900, when albion drew 1–1 with derby county in front of a crowd of 20,104. derby\\'s england international steve bloomer scored the first hawthorns goal, with chippy simmons equalizing for albion. the first saturday game followed soon after, with albion losing out 0–1 to fierce local rivals aston villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. the 1900–01 campaign was not a successful one however, as albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to division two. their defeat to sheffield united on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the hawthorns.\\nthe ground was gradually expanded and 1923 saw the first ever 50,000+ gate with 56,474 watching a 2–1 win in the cup against sunderland. the first 60,000+ gate followed in 1925, with 64,612 fans watching a cup tie with arch-rivals aston villa. the all-time attendance record at the hawthorns was set on 6 march 1937, when 64,815 spectators crammed in to see albion beat hot-favourites arsenal 3–1 in the fa cup quarter-final. it is worth noting that this attendance was probably bettered, when albion played newcastle in a fifth round tie in 1954, when over 80,000 people turned up. the official crowd was put at 61,088. the highest ever league crowd was for a 1–1 draw 60,945 against wolves on 4 march 1950.\\n\\nconcrete terracing was added to the ground in 1920. in 1949 the ground became the first in britain to have an electronic turnstile aggregator fitted, in order to automatically calculate attendances. in 1957 electric floodlights were erected, at a cost of £18,000. the ground\\'s first floodlit match saw albion draw 1–1 with chelsea, on 18 september 1957. soon afterwards a friendly game against the russian red army was organised to officially open them. albion won 6–5 in front of 53,805 fans. the ground was once divided by the birmingham/smethwick border, but was moved completely into the latter by a minor rationalisation of local government borders in the 1960s and is now entirely in sandwell. in 1964 the large handsworth side terrace was replaced by the rainbow stand at a cost of £40,000, reducing capacity to around 50,000. in october 1968, closed-circuit television was installed at the ground, in an attempt to ward off \"increasing hooliganism\". over the following decades capacity was further reduced and perimeter fences were built to help tackle hooliganism. the halfords lane stand was rebuilt in two separate phases between 1979 and 1982, at a cost of around £2.5 million.\\nby the end of the 1980s, the capacity had been slashed dramatically to just over 30,000, with attendances frequently dropping below half that figure. the hawthorns was become increasingly dilapidated and in need of modernisation.\\n\\nfollowing the taylor report in january 1990, the ground became all-seated with first the smethwick end and then the much-loved birmingham road end terraces being demolished and replaced by all-seater stands, giving it a capacity of more than 25,000 by the mid 1990s. the official re-opening of the redeveloped ground saw albion beat bristol city 1–0 on boxing day in 1994. during the mid-late 1990s there were proposals for moseley rugby football club to share the ground, but these never materialised. albion celebrated the stadium\\'s centenary on 3 september 2000 by beating crystal palace 1–0 in a division one match. in 2001 the rainbow stand was replaced by the new east stand.\\nin 2002, the hawthorns became the first ground to install big screens in the widescreen format. the ground hosted its first premier league match on 24 august 2002, with albion losing 3–1 to leeds united. leeds player harry kewell scored the first premier league goal on the ground. the jeff astle gates, which commemorate one of albion\\'s greatest strikers, were unveiled on 11 july 2003. the gates are located on the birmingham road, close to the woodman corner, and form the entrance to the east stand car park. in december 2003, the board of directors unveiled plans to increase the stadium\\'s capacity to 40,000 all-seated. however, these plans were scrapped as albion slipped out of the premiership in 2006.\\n\\nthere had been plans for the halfords lane stand to be rebuilt, but these were shelved due to what albion chairman jeremy peace called \"continuing levels of excess capacity\". the stand was instead refurbished and became known as the west stand, with the capacity reduced to 26,272. plans were again announced to expand capacity after west bromwich finished in their highest league position since 1983. the plans involved an increase of capacity to around 30,000 by 2014, regardless of league performance. however, this never materialised and the hawthorns still awaits its first major development in nearly two decades.\\n\\nwest stand.constructed: 1979–1981\\nrefurbished: 2008\\ncapacity: 4,725 (seated)\\n\\nrunning along the west edge of the pitch and along halford\\'s lane, the west stand (formerly the halford\\'s lane stand) provided vip seating before the advent of the new east stand. the stand houses the main tv cameras as well as the press and commentary area. chairman jeremy peace had announced that there are plans for the halfords lane stand to be demolished to make way for a single-tier, 10,000 seated stand within the next five years. this would raise the total stadium capacity to around 33,000. however, since albion\\'s relegation from the premier league and a drop in attendances, this plan has been shelved for the time being, although albion did regain their top flight status in 2008. the stand has instead been refurbished, cutting capacity from 28,003 to 26,272.\\n\\nbirmingham road end.constructed: 1994\\ncapacity: 8,286 (seated) (including woodman corner)\\n\\naffectionately called the brummie road by supporters, the birmingham road end runs behind the goal, adjacent to the a41. traditionally, it has always housed the core of the home support and was the main source of the so-called albion roar. when a terrace, it held up to 14,000, but the stand which replaced it in 1994 holds 8,000 all-seated spectators. between this stand and the east stand lies the woodman corner, named after the woodman pub which stood just behind it until its demolition in 2004. the woodman corner is home to a large throstle mascot, which was originally perched above the old (terraced) woodman corner, but was housed in the halfords lane stand for several seasons until the stadium redevelopments were completed. there are plans in place to expand the woodman corner in the future.\\n\\nsmethwick end.constructed: 1994\\ncapacity: 5,200 (seated)\\n\\nrunning behind the goal at the southern edge of the pitch, the smethwick end houses the away supporters though they are only allocated part of the stand, except for cup matches. the remainder houses the most vocal of the home support (if the new west stand is completed, there may be a chance of the smethwick end going to the visitors). development in the summer of 2014 increased the stadium capacity to 26,850, with added seats made available in the smethwick end due to the movement of the police control room.\\n\\neast stand.constructed: 2001\\ncapacity: 8,791 (seated)\\n\\nreplacing the old rainbow stand, the east stand now houses the club\\'s administration offices, club shop, club ticket office and corporate entertainment suites. the wings of the east stand are known as the woodman corner (which joins up with the birmingham road end, and is named after the woodman public house that stood there until 2004) and the millennium corner (adjacent to the smethwick end).\\n\\nabove the woodman corner sits a giant effigy of a throstle, which had been a familiar feature of the ground for generations. it used to perch on the old scoreboard in the old (terraced) woodman corner; after the redevelopment of the ground in 1994 it was moved temporarily to the main stand in halfords lane, and it can now be seen back in its old position.\\n\\nthe rainbow stand was built in 1964, originally known as the east stand, but gained the name rainbow stand over the next few years owing to its brightly painted seats. it originally consisted of standing accommodation in the lower section and seating in the upper section. however, a refurbishment project in 1977 saw the terracing replaced by executive boxes and seating. it survived until 2000, when it was demolished to make way for the new stand which opened in the 2000–01 season.\\n\\nother uses.as well as serving as the home ground of west bromwich albion, the hawthorns has hosted a number of other football matches. it has hosted two full england internationals: on 21 october 1922, england beat ireland 2–0, while on 8 december 1924 they won 4–0 against belgium. the hawthorns hosted a \\'b\\' international for the first time in february 1998, when england b lost 2–1 to chile. two months later, a women\\'s international friendly was hosted, italy winning 2–1 against england.\\nthe ground also hosted the first post-war match between england and wales on 20 october 1945, in which england lost 0–1 to wales in front of 54,611 people. also, two fa cup semi-finals have been staged at the ground. the first saw derby county draw 1–1 to sheffield united in 1902 and the second took place between aston villa and wolverhampton wanderers in 1960. wolves won 1–0 in front of 55,596.\\n\\nthe ground has additionally been the venue for other sporting events. in its early years, the ground was used for athletics meetings; in may 1908, birchfield harriers used the hawthorns for their spring meeting, which included the end of the first marathon to be run in the midlands. the runners covered 25 mi from coventry to the hawthorns, and one of them – jack price of small heath harriers – was selected for the british team for the london olympic games on the strength of his performance. \\n\\nin the late 1970s the hawthorns was the venue for a cricket match between india and pakistan, watched by 2,641 spectators, while in 2000 and 2001 the ground hosted kabaddi tournaments. on 11 january 1987, telford united (a non league side playing some 30 miles away in shropshire) switched their fa cup tie against leeds united to the hawthorns as they had refused to host it at their own stadium as leeds fans were notorious for hooliganism at this time.\\n\\nrecords.- all-time record attendance: 64,815 v arsenal, 6 march 1937 (fa cup sixth round)\\n- modern all-seated record attendance: 27,751 v portsmouth, 15 may 2005

from the ground. due to the large number of fans travelling in both directions to and from the hawthorns on matchdays, trains run more frequently at those times, and have been known to depart every ten minutes. that has helped to reduce the time taken for travelling fans to leave west bromwich and return home.\\n\\nbus route 74, which runs between birmingham and dudley, passes the stadium along

            "MAIN TEXT!!!! Brunt returned to first-team action after eight months out with an anterior cruciate knee injury in the 1–1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at The Hawthorns on 15 October 2016. He scored his first goal of the 2016–17 season on 3 December in a 3–1 home win over Watford, ending a run of 29 Premier League appearances without a goal. His second goal of the season came on 2 January 2017 in a 3–1 home victory against Hull City, when he headed in from a Matt Phillips corner kick. 12 days later, he made his 300th league appearance and 200th Premier League start for West Brom in the next fixture against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane which ended in a 4–0 defeat for the West Midlands club. On 9 February 2017, Brunt signed a contract extension which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2018 with an option for another year should he trigger a clause relating to appearances. He made his 500th career appearance in club football against Burnley in August 2017 and the following month made his 350th appearance for Albion, against Watford. Following the departure of Jonny Evans and Albion's relegation in 2018, new manager Darren Moore reinstated Brunt as club captain: he played 32 matches in the EFL Championship as the Baggies finished 4th, losing in the play-offs to local rivals Aston Villa. \n",

has been the home of west bromwich albion f.c. since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. the hawthorns was the last football league ground to be built in the 19th century opening in september 1900, after construction work took only 4 months. at an altitude of 551 ft, it is the highest ground among those of all 92 premier league and football league clubs.\\n\\nprevious grounds.during the early years of the club, west bromwich albion led something of a nomadic existence, playing at five different grounds in a 22-year period. their first ground was cooper\\'s hill, which the club occupied from 1878 to 1879. from 1879 to 1881 they played at dartmouth park, although they may also have alternated between there and cooper\\'s hill during this period. albion\\'s third ground was bunn\\'s field, also known as the birches, where they played for a single season in 1881–82. with a capacity of 1500–2000, it was their first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. the increasing popularity of football led the well-established west bromwich dartmouth cricket club to rent their four acres ground to albion from 1882 to 1885, but they quickly outgrew their new home and soon needed to move again. albion\\'s tenure of stoney lane, from 1885 to 1900, was arguably the most successful period in the club\\'s history, as the club won the fa cup twice and were runners-up three times.\\n\\nhistory.the expiry of the lease on stoney lane, as well as the club\\'s desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. all of albion\\'s previous grounds had been close to the centre of west bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an \"out of town\" site on the borders of handsworth. the area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the hawthorns. the club signed a lease for the land on 14 may 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, sandwell park colliery, and albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in june 1913.\\n\\nwhen opened, the hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. the first match took place on monday 3 september 1900, when albion drew 1–1 with derby county in front of a crowd of 20,104. derby\\'s england international steve bloomer scored the first hawthorns goal, with chippy simmons equalizing for albion. the first saturday game followed soon after, with albion losing out 0–1 to fierce local rivals aston villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. the 1900–01 campaign was not a successful one however, as albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to division two. their defeat to sheffield united on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the hawthorns.\\nthe ground was gradually expanded and 1923 saw the first ever 50,000+ gate with 56,474 watching a 2–1 win in the cup against sunderland. the first 60,000+ gate followed in 1925, with 64,612 fans watching a cup tie with arch-rivals aston villa. the all-time attendance record at the hawthorns was set on 6 march 1937, when 64,815 spectators crammed in to see albion beat hot-favourites arsenal 3–1 in the fa cup quarter-final. it is worth noting that this attendance was probably bettered, when albion played newcastle in a fifth round tie in 1954, when over 80,000 people turned up. the official crowd was put at 61,088. the highest ever league crowd was for a 1–1 draw 60,945 against wolves on 4 march 1950.\\n\\nconcrete terracing was added to the ground in 1920. in 1949 the ground became the first in britain to have an electronic turnstile aggregator fitted, in order to automatically calculate attendances. in 1957 electric floodlights were erected, at a cost of £18,000. the ground\\'s first floodlit match saw albion draw 1–1 with chelsea, on 18 september 1957. soon afterwards a friendly game against the russian red army was organised to officially open them. albion won 6–5 in front of 53,805 fans. the ground was once divided by the birmingham/smethwick border, but was moved completely into the latter by a minor rationalisation of local government borders in the 1960s and is now entirely in sandwell. in 1964 the large handsworth side terrace was replaced by the rainbow stand at a cost of £40,000, reducing capacity to around 50,000. in october 1968, closed-circuit television was installed at the ground, in an attempt to ward off \"increasing hooliganism\". over the following decades capacity was further reduced and perimeter fences were built to help tackle hooliganism. the halfords lane stand was rebuilt in two separate phases between 1979 and 1982, at a cost of around £2.5 million.\\nby the end of the 1980s, the capacity had been slashed dramatically to just over 30,000, with attendances frequently dropping below half that figure. the hawthorns was become increasingly dilapidated and in need of modernisation.\\n\\nfollowing the taylor report in january 1990, the ground became all-seated with first the smethwick end and then the much-loved birmingham road end terraces being demolished and replaced by all-seater stands, giving it a capacity of more than 25,000 by the mid 1990s. the official re-opening of the redeveloped ground saw albion beat bristol city 1–0 on boxing day in 1994. during the mid-late 1990s there were proposals for moseley rugby football club to share the ground, but these never materialised. albion celebrated the stadium\\'s centenary on 3 september 2000 by beating crystal palace 1–0 in a division one match. in 2001 the rainbow stand was replaced by the new east stand.\\nin 2002, the hawthorns became the first ground to install big screens in the widescreen format. the ground hosted its first premier league match on 24 august 2002, with albion losing 3–1 to leeds united. leeds player harry kewell scored the first premier league goal on the ground. the jeff astle gates, which commemorate one of albion\\'s greatest strikers, were unveiled on 11 july 2003. the gates are located on the birmingham road, close to the woodman corner, and form the entrance to the east stand car park. in december 2003, the board of directors unveiled plans to increase the stadium\\'s capacity to 40,000 all-seated. however, these plans were scrapped as albion slipped out of the premiership in 2006.\\n\\nthere had been plans for the halfords lane stand to be rebuilt, but these were shelved due to what albion chairman jeremy peace called \"continuing levels of excess capacity\". the stand was instead refurbished and became known as the west stand, with the capacity reduced to 26,272. plans were again announced to expand capacity after west bromwich finished in their highest league position since 1983. the plans involved an increase of capacity to around 30,000 by 2014, regardless of league performance. however, this never materialised and the hawthorns still awaits its first major development in nearly two decades.\\n\\nwest stand.constructed: 1979–1981\\nrefurbished: 2008\\ncapacity: 4,725 (seated)\\n\\nrunning along the west edge of the pitch and along halford\\'s lane, the west stand (formerly the halford\\'s lane stand) provided vip seating before the advent of the new east stand. the stand houses the main tv cameras as well as the press and commentary area. chairman jeremy peace had announced that there are plans for the halfords lane stand to be demolished to make way for a single-tier, 10,000 seated stand within the next five years. this would raise the total stadium capacity to around 33,000. however, since albion\\'s relegation from the premier league and a drop in attendances, this plan has been shelved for the time being, although albion did regain their top flight status in 2008. the stand has instead been refurbished, cutting capacity from 28,003 to 26,272.\\n\\nbirmingham road end.constructed: 1994\\ncapacity: 8,286 (seated) (including woodman corner)\\n\\naffectionately called the brummie road by supporters, the birmingham road end runs behind the goal, adjacent to the a41. traditionally, it has always housed the core of the home support and was the main source of the so-called albion roar. when a terrace, it held up to 14,000, but the stand which replaced it in 1994 holds 8,000 all-seated spectators. between this stand and the east stand lies the woodman corner, named after the woodman pub which stood just behind it until its demolition in 2004. the woodman corner is home to a large throstle mascot, which was originally perched above the old (terraced) woodman corner, but was housed in the halfords lane stand for several seasons until the stadium redevelopments were completed. there are plans in place to expand the woodman corner in the future.\\n\\nsmethwick end.constructed: 1994\\ncapacity: 5,200 (seated)\\n\\nrunning behind the goal at the southern edge of the pitch, the smethwick end houses the away supporters though they are only allocated part of the stand, except for cup matches. the remainder houses the most vocal of the home support (if the new west stand is completed, there may be a chance of the smethwick end going to the visitors). development in the summer of 2014 increased the stadium capacity to 26,850, with added seats made available in the smethwick end due to the movement of the police control room.\\n\\neast stand.constructed: 2001\\ncapacity: 8,791 (seated)\\n\\nreplacing the old rainbow stand, the east stand now houses the club\\'s administration offices, club shop, club ticket office and corporate entertainment suites. the wings of the east stand are known as the woodman corner (which joins up with the birmingham road end, and is named after the woodman public house that stood there until 2004) and the millennium corner (adjacent to the smethwick end).\\n\\nabove the woodman corner sits a giant effigy of a throstle, which had been a familiar feature of the ground for generations. it used to perch on the old scoreboard in the old (terraced) woodman corner; after the redevelopment of the ground in 1994 it was moved temporarily to the main stand in halfords lane, and it can now be seen back in its old position.\\n\\nthe rainbow stand was built in 1964, originally known as the east stand, but gained the name rainbow stand over the next few years owing to its brightly painted seats. it originally consisted of standing accommodation in the lower section and seating in the upper section. however, a refurbishment project in 1977 saw the terracing replaced by executive boxes and seating. it survived until 2000, when it was demolished to make way for the new stand which opened in the 2000–01 season.\\n\\nother uses.as well as serving as the home ground of west bromwich albion, the hawthorns has hosted a number of other football matches. it has hosted two full england internationals: on 21 october 1922, england beat ireland 2–0, while on 8 december 1924 they won 4–0 against belgium. the hawthorns hosted a \\'b\\' international for the first time in february 1998, when england b lost 2–1 to chile. two months later, a women\\'s international friendly was hosted, italy winning 2–1 against england.\\nthe ground also hosted the first post-war match between england and wales on 20 october 1945, in which england lost 0–1 to wales in front of 54,611 people. also, two fa cup semi-finals have been staged at the ground. the first saw derby county draw 1–1 to sheffield united in 1902 and the second took place between aston villa and wolverhampton wanderers in 1960. wolves won 1–0 in front of 55,596.\\n\\nthe ground has additionally been the venue for other sporting events. in its early years, the ground was used for athletics meetings; in may 1908, birchfield harriers used the hawthorns for their spring meeting, which included the end of the first marathon to be run in the midlands. the runners covered 25 mi from coventry to the hawthorns, and one of them – jack price of small heath harriers – was selected for the british team for the london olympic games on the strength of his performance. \\n\\nin the late 1970s the hawthorns was the venue for a cricket match between india and pakistan, watched by 2,641 spectators, while in 2000 and 2001 the ground hosted kabaddi tournaments. on 11 january 1987, telford united (a non league side playing some 30 miles away in shropshire) switched their fa cup tie against leeds united to the hawthorns as they had refused to host it at their own stadium as leeds fans were notorious for hooliganism at this time.\\n\\nrecords.- all-time record attendance: 64,815 v arsenal, 6 march 1937 (fa cup sixth round)\\n- modern all-seated record attendance: 27,751 v portsmouth, 15 may 2005

from the ground. due to the large number of fans travelling in both directions to and from the hawthorns on matchdays, trains run more frequently at those times, and have been known to depart every ten minutes. that has helped to reduce the time taken for travelling fans to leave west bromwich and return home.\\n\\nbus route 74, which runs between birmingham and dudley, passes the stadium along

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'White Hart Lane', 'contents': 'white hart lane was a football stadium in tottenham, north london and the home of tottenham hotspur football club from 1899 to 2017. its capacity varied over the years; when changed to all-seater it had a capacity of 36,284 before demolition. the stadium was fully demolished after the end of the 2016–17 season and was replaced by tottenham hotspur stadium as the club\\'s home ground.\\n\\nthe stadium, which was known amongst spurs fans as the lane, had hosted 2,533 competitive spurs games in its 118-year history. it had also been used for england national football matches and england under-21 football matches. white hart lane once had capacity of nearly 80,000 with attendances in the early 1950s that reached the 70,000s, but as seating was introduced, the stadium\\'s capacity decreased to a modest number in comparison to other premier league clubs. the record attendance at the ground was 75,038, for an fa cup tie on 5 march 1938 against sunderland. tottenham\\'s final game at white hart lane was played on 14 may 2017 with a 2–1 victory against manchester united.\\n\\nin 2019, tottenham moved to a new stadium with a capacity of 62,062 designed by populous. the new stadium was built in the same area instead of moving elsewhere or from the borough of haringey.\\n\\norigin.when the club was first formed in 1882, the club played its matches on public land at the park lane end of tottenham marshes. as the ground was on public land, the club could not charge admission fees for spectators, and while the number of spectators grew to a few thousands within a few years, it yielded no gate receipts. in 1888, the club rented a pitch at asplins farm next to the railway line at northumberland park at a cost of £17 per annum, with the spectators charged 3d a game. the first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built on the ground for the 1894–95 season. overcrowding at the ground however became an issue; in 1898, during a match against woolwich arsenal attended by a record crowd of 15,000, the refreshment stand collapsed when fans climbed up onto its roof, prompting the club to start looking for a new ground. in 1899, the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the white hart pub.\\n\\nthe new location was to the east of tottenham high road. the site was formerly used as a nursery owned by the brewery company charringtons. the ground was leased from charringtons with the proviso that spurs must guarantee crowds of 1,000 for first-team matches and 500 for the reserves, easily achievable when the average attendance of tottenham\\'s matches was 4,000. a groundsman at a local cricket club, john over, was tasked with demolishing the greenhouses and preparing a playing surface for football. the stands from the previous ground at northumberland park were moved to the new ground. the new ground was never officially named, although names such as gilpin park and percy park were suggested. in its early days it was normally referred to as the hotspur\\'s or spurs\\' ground by the club or the high road ground by the public, in time it became popularly known as white hart lane, which is in fact the name of the street on the western side of the high road, away from the ground. it is however unclear how it became so-named; some thought that it acquired the name because spectators would first meet up at the white hart lane railway station, another suggestion is that it referred to the lane leading to the stadium entrance beside the white hart pub later officially named bill nicholson way.\\nthe first game at the lane to mark its opening was a friendly against notts county on 4 september 1899, with around 5,000 supporters attending, generating a gate receipt of £115. the first goal at the lane came from tommy mccairns of notts county, followed by an equaliser from tom pratt and a hat-trick from david copeland, ending in a 4–1 home win. the first competitive game on the ground was held five days later in front of an 11,000 crowd against queens park rangers, which spurs won 1–0 with the only goal scored by tom smith.\\n\\nby 1904, the groundhad an overall capacity of 32,000, with a main stand that provided seating for 500, and covered accommodation for 12,000. in february 1904, overcrowding during an fa cup match against aston villa led to the abandonment of the match and a pitch invasion by fans, resulting in the club being fined and ordered to erect a steel fence around the pitch. the ground needed to be expanded; although a large earth bank was built at the park lane end in 1904, the club\\'s ability to develop the white hart lane site was restricted by the terms of the ground lease with charringtons. following a share issue, the club bought the freehold for £8,900 in 1905. an additional £2,600 was used to purchase the land at the northern (paxton road) end, where another large bank was built the same year to match the one at the park lane end, bringing the capacity up to 40,000. spurs were admitted to the second division of the football league in 1908, and played their first league game on 1 september 1908 against wolverhampton wanderers at white hart lane. spurs won 3–0, and the first football league goal on the ground was scored by vivian woodward.\\n\\nredevelopment.white hart lane underwent redevelopment in the early 20th century with stadium developer, archibald leitch, who designed the stands that were built over a period of two and a half decades. the first to be designed, the main west stand, was a two-tiered structure, with seating for 5,300 in the upper tier and a paddock in front with standing room for over 6,000. the roof covered the whole stand and featured a mock-tudor gable, emblazoned with the club\\'s name. at the time, it was the largest stand at a british football ground. built at a cost of £50,000, it opened on september 11, 1909 for spurs\\' first home game in division one, which was a match against manchester united that ended in a 2–2 draw. the central section of the east stand was also covered in 1909 and two years later its wooden terrace was replaced by an enlarged concrete terrace, with the roof extended to cover the whole stand. with further expansion of the banking at the two ends, the stadium capacity increased to over 50,000 by the onset of the first world war. during the war, the stadium was taken over by the ministry of war and the east stand was turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment.\\nthe pitch was overlooked by a bronze fighting cock (the club symbol) that kept an eye on proceedings from the roof of the touchline stands. the cockerel was adopted as an emblem for the club as harry hotspur, after whom the club was named, wore spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles, and spurs are also associated with fighting cocks. the original cockerel on a ball was erected in 1909 and was cast by william james scott, who had played for the club when it was an amateur club. it was originally located atop the west stand but was removed in 1957 for upgrading of floodlighting and reappeared on top of the east stand in december 1958. in 1989, the original cockerel was removed to be replaced by fibreglass replicas that were placed on top of both the east stand and west stand. the original cockerel was moved to the executive suites where it stayed for many years, then to the west stand reception. it was moved to the club offices at lilywhite house in 2016 as the stadium was due to be demolished for redevelopment.\\n\\nthe ground continued to be renovated in the 1920s and early 1930s, with three more stands designed by archibald leitch. the fa cup win in 1921 provided money to build a covered, two-tiered terrace at the paxton road end and, in 1923, a similar stand was added at the park lane end. the capacity had now reached 58,000, with about 40,000 under cover. in 1934 the club spent £60,000 to rebuild the east stand. the new stand was a double-decker structure, with the lower section in two tiers; the upper section had 4,983 seats, while the middle tier, which was to become known as \"the shelf\", and lower terrace provided standing room for over 18,700. the shelf became a place where ardent fans congregated, unlike many other stadiums where the stands behind the goals are the preferred gathering place for the loudest fans. the total stadium capacity was now nearly 80,000. the east stand was officially opened on 22 september 1934 for a match against aston villa.\\n\\nin the 1930s, football had a popular following, and despite tottenham\\'s relative lack of success at the time, 75,038 spectators squeezed into white hart lane in march 1938 to see spurs\\' performance against sunderland in the fa cup. the redeveloped stadium was also used for international matches; in 1935 it hosted a game between nazi germany and england that england won, 3–0. the venue also hosted some of the football preliminaries for the 1948 summer olympics. during the second world war, spurs shared the ground with rival arsenal when highbury was requisitioned by the government and used as an air raid precautions centre.\\n\\ntottenham became firmly established as one of england\\'s biggest clubs that attracted some of the highest attendances in the country on a regular basis. attendance at white hart lane averaged at over 53,000 in 1961, their double winning year. between the late 1920s and 1972, white hart lane was one of very few british football grounds that featured no advertising hoardings at all.\\n\\n1953 saw the introduction of floodlights, with their first use being a friendly against racing club de paris in september of that year. they were upgraded in 1957, and in 1961, floodlight pylons were installed. these were renovated again in the 1970s, and in 1990 the floodlight pylons were replaced with spotlights mounted on the east and west stands.\\n\\nall-seater stadium.the stadium as designed by archibald leitch stayed in the same form for a few decades, seating sections however were progressively introduced. in 1962, 2,600 seats were fitted at the back of the south stand (on park lane), followed the next year by 3,500 seats at the north (paxton road) stand, which was further extended in 1968 to link up with the west stand to give a further 1,400 seats. the south and west stands were linked in 1973, adding further seats, but the capacity of the ground dropped overall as seats replaced standing terraces.\\n\\nin 1980, in a bid to improve facilities and upgrade what was then considered an outdated stadium, a new phase of redevelopment began that transformed the ground. the new chairman, arthur richardson, green-lit the project over the skepticism of previous chairman sidney wale. the old west stand was demolished in november 1980 to be replaced by a new stand designed by ernest atherden that had 6,500 seats and featured 72 executive boxes. the new west stand opened 15 months later on 6 february 1982 for a match against wolverhampton wanderers, won by spurs 6–1, with a hat-trick from ricky villa. however, cost overruns in the project, which rose from £3.5 million to £6 million, and the cost of rebuilding the team, resulted in financial difficulties for the club. irving scholar took advantage of a rift in the boardroom and bought out the shares of wale, leading to a change of directors.\\nin 1985, a plan to demolish and rebuild the east stand was rejected by haringey council. in 1988, the club decided to proceed instead with a refurbishment of the east stand despite objections by fans. the long stretch of raised standing terrace on the east stand, known by fans as the shelf, was redesigned to include the installation of executive boxes replacing the upper section of the standing terrace. work on the east stand however caused the opening game of the 1988–89 season against coventry to be postponed a few hours before kickoff. the east stand was closed that season. work on the stadium continued in the summer of 1989 and the refurbished east stand opened on 18 october 1989 for the north london derby. the cost of the project however, doubled to over £8 million; this, together with other financial problems, would again lead to a change of directors at the club in 1991.\\nthere was perimeter fencing in the 1980s between the stands behind the goals and the pitch; fencing was first erected in british football stadiums to segregate away fans in the 1970s and to combat the threat of pitch invasions from hooligans. fencing began to be removed in the later part of the 1980s, and all the fences were removed on 18 april 1989 for safety reasons in reaction to the hillsborough disaster three days earlier, in which 96 liverpool fans were fatally injured, most of them crushed to death against the perimeter fencing in an overcrowded standing area. the fencing at the same place had also previously caused an incidence of crushing of spurs fans during a cup tie in 1981.\\nalso as a response to the hillsborough disaster, and the subsequent taylor report of 1990 that called for all-seater stadiums, standing areas were removed over the next few years, further reducing the capacity of the ground. standing areas on the lower terraces of the east and south stands were replaced with seating in 1992, followed by the north stand the next year. the south stand was demolished in 1994, and its redevelopment completed in march 1995. the work was partly funded by the football trust. the first jumbotron video screen for live coverage and screening of away matches was also installed above the south stand, and there would eventually be two screens, one above each penalty area. the renovation, and the addition of a second tier to the members\\' (north) stand on paxton road, was completed in 1998, leaving the stadium with a capacity of 36,240. the stadium would stay in this form, bar some minor adjustments, until 2016, when the north-east corner of the stadium was demolished to allow for the construction of a new stadium, while the final 2016–17 season was being played at white hart lane.\\n\\nnew stadium.by the turn of the millennium, the capacity of white hart lane had fallen significantly behind compared to other major premier league clubs who had plans to expand further (for example, proposed development of old trafford had a projected capacity of 79,000 while arsenal planned to build a new stadium that would seat 60,000). talks began over the redevelopment and future of white hart lane, and many stadium designs and ideas were rumoured in the media, with the possibility of tottenham hotspur moving home also mooted. however, a move to wembley stadium was ruled out by the club, as was talk of moving to the olympic stadium in stratford after completion of the 2012 olympic games. ultimately the club\\'s owners, enic group, decided to focus solely on the ongoing redevelopment plan for white hart lane as part of the northumberland development project.\\n\\nsections of the north and east stands at the north-east corner were removed in 2016 to allow construction of the new stadium next to the old stadium in the final season at the lane. as this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for european games, tottenham hotspur played every european home game in 2016–17 at wembley stadium. on 14 may 2017, white hart lane hosted its final match in a premier league encounter between tottenham hotspur and manchester united. it ended in a 2–1 victory for the home side, securing the highest league ranking for spurs since 1963, with goals from victor wanyama and harry kane. the last goal at the stadium was scored by manchester united\\'s striker wayne rooney. demolition work on the stadium began the following day and was completed by august 2017.\\nother uses.the stadium hosted many international football matches. one notable match took place in 1935 when england played nazi germany, which led to protests by jewish groups. the match ended in a 3–0 win for england. during the construction of the new wembley stadium, white hart lane hosted full england international matches, such as a 2–0 defeat to holland. since the opening of the rebuilt wembley, the lane had been occasionally used to host england under-21s international matches, most notably a 1–1 draw against france under-21s.\\n\\nthe ground had been used for other sports and events since the early years such as baseball (there was once a spurs baseball team). it was used for many boxing matches over many years, the earliest matches being held in 1922. there had been a number of notable boxing matches at the stadium; for example, the match between jack london vs bruce woodcock in 1945, the frank bruno vs joe bugner bout in 1987, and the fight on 21 september 1991 where michael watson collapsed with a near fatal brain injury after a bout with chris eubank.\\n\\nin 1995 and 1996 white hart lane also hosted american football, as the home ground of the london monarchs. because the pitch could not accommodate a regulation-length american football field, the monarchs received special permission from the world league to play on a 93-yard field. the new stadium will continue this association with american football as an artificial turf field will be located beneath its retractable grass pitch and be used for the american gridiron code of football.\\n\\nstructure and facilities.the outer white hart lane frame was designed in a rectangular shape, with the inner seating tiers being rounded to maximise the number of seats possible within the structure. the cockerel was placed upon the west stand, with the west stand located on tottenham high road, the east stand being on worcester avenue, the north stand on paxton road and the south stand on park lane. the stands were officially named after compass points, but were more colloquially referred to by the road onto which they back.\\n\\nthe capacity of the stands before the demolition of part of white hart lane, in summer 2016, was as follows:\\n\\nthe pitch at white hart lane, at 100 × 67 metres (or 6,700 square meters), was one of the smallest in the premier league.\\n\\nrecords.tottenham\\'s biggest win at the stadium came in an fa cup tie against crewe in february 1960, with a 13–2 final score. this was also the highest score seen at the stadium. the biggest win in the football league at the stadium took place on 22 october 1977 against bristol rovers, which finished 9–0. on 22 november 2009, tottenham defeated wigan athletic 9–1 in the premier league. the club\\'s biggest defeats at the venue were 0–6 scores in division one, firstly against sunderland on 19 december 1914 and later against arsenal on 6 march 1935.\\n\\nthe player with the most appearances at white hart lane is steve perryman who played 436 games, while jimmy greaves scored the most goals, with 176 goals at the lane. the highest attendance recorded at the lane was 75,038 for the sixth round fa cup tie against sunderland, 5 march 1938. it was also the highest ever gate for a home match at the club until 2016 when over 85,000 attended the 2016–17 uefa champions league match against monaco, held at wembley stadium, which was their temporary home for european matches that season.\\n\\ntransport.the area close to the stadium is regularly served by many different bus routes and services. bus routes 149, 259, 279, and 349 stop outside the ground. white hart lane and northumberland park national rail stations are 0.2 mi and 0.7 mi away, respectively. tottenham hale, a rail and tube station, and seven sisters tube station are also nearby. there are controlled parking zones in operation in the area on all match days.\\n\\nfuture with new stadium.there have been a number of plans in the past for relocation. the first, reported in 2001, was to relocate to a proposed 43,000-seat stadium at pickett\\'s lock, intended for the 2005 world athletics championships to be held in london. however, the stadium was never built as the government deemed the project too expensive, and the venue of the games was eventually moved to helsinki.\\n\\nover the next few years various other schemes were suggested, including a relocation to the rebuilt wembley stadium (which finally opened in 2007). on 1 october 2010, ostensibly as a back-up to the plans for a new stadium, tottenham registered interest in making use of the olympic stadium, being built for the 2012 london olympics, in conjunction with aeg, owners and operators of the o in london\\'s greenwich, formerly known as the millennium dome. the club also proposed rebuilding on the site after the 2012 olympics. however, spurs bid for the stadium was rejected on 11 february 2011. spurs pursued legal action over the ruling to give the stratford stadium to west ham united, but later withdrew.\\n\\nthe club also pursued another option, namely the northumberland development project (ndp). this involved a plan to build a new stadium, partly on the site of the existing white hart lane ground, and include leisure facilities, shops, housing, a club museum, a public space and also a new base for the tottenham hotspur foundation. the ndp was announced on 30 october 2008 to develop the current site and land to its north, to construct a totally new 56,250-seat stadium. on 26 october 2009, the club submitted their planning application, hoping to start work on the new ground in 2010, and to be playing in it come 2012. but in may 2010, following adverse reaction, this was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application. haringey council were requested on 30 september 2010 to grant permission for the new stadium and other associated developments (subject to negotiation of \\'section 106\\' developer contributions). the new plans were referred to english heritage, the mayor of london and the secretary of state for a final decision. the mayor of london, boris johnson, approved the plans on 25 november 2010. on 20 september 2011, planning permission was granted (planning reference hgy/2010/1000).\\nthe development plans had been revised several times during a lengthy delay because of a compulsory purchase order (cpo). this cpo was eventually issued in july 2014, giving approval for the new stadium scheme to proceed, but was subject to an unsuccessful legal challenge by a business located within the proposed site in february 2015. on 8 july 2015, tottenham announced brand new revised plans, including a larger 61,000 capacity, making it the biggest club stadium in london. the revised stadium design also included a 17,000 seat single tier stand, the biggest of its kind in the uk. the new plan also included a combination of 585 new homes, a 180-room hotel, an extreme sports building, a community health centre, enhanced public spaces and \\'the tottenham experience\\' – an interactive museum and club shop complex incorporating the listed warmington house. additionally, on 8 july 2015 it was announced by the club that the new stadium would host two nfl international series games, every year, for ten years.\\n\\non 16 december 2015, the revised plans were approved by haringey council (planning reference hgy/2015/3000) that would enable phase 2 of the ndp to begin, as phase 1 (lilywhite

He was educated at the gymnasium of his native town and at the University of Berlin, where he devoted himself to philological and historical studies. In 1813-1814 he took part, as a volunteer in the Prussian army, in the national rising against Napoleon. He participated in the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Hanau and Kulm. In 1814 he returned to his studies at Berlin. From 1817 to 1819, he visited southern Germany and Italy, and in 1820 published his impressions of the latter in Rom, Römer und Römerinnen. In 1819, he was appointed teacher of classics in the Gelehrtenschule at Dessau, and in 1820 librarian to the ducal library. He remained there the rest of his life, dying of a heart attack aged only 32. Müller's son, Friedrich Max Müller, was an English orientalist who founded the comparative study of religions; his grandson Wilhelm Max Müller was an American Oriental scholar.\n",

advances of the sixth coalition after the french invasion of russia and the massive french losses in the campaign. the russian commander, prince peter wittgenstein, attempting to forestall napoleon\\'s capture of leipzig, attacked the isolated french right wing near lützen, germany. after a day of heavy fighting, the combined prussian and russian force retreated; due to french losses and a shortage of french cavalry, napoleon was unable to conduct a pursuit.\\n\\nprelude.following the disaster of french invasion of russia in 1812, a new coalition formed against him. in response to this, napoleon hastily assembled an army of just over 200,000 consisting largely of inexperienced, barely trained recruits and severely short of horses (a consequence of the russian invasion, where most of his veteran troops and horses had perished). he crossed the rhine into germany to link up with remnants of his old grande armée, and to quickly defeat this new alliance before it became too strong. \\n\\non the 30 april napoleon crossed the river saale, advancing on leipzig in three columns led by an advanced guard. his intention was to work his way into the coalition\\'s interior lines, dividing their forces and defeating them in detail before they could combine. but due to inexperienced cavalrymen and faulty reconnaissance, he was unaware of 73,000 allied troops under wittgenstein and graf (count) von blücher concentrating on his right flank to the south. marshal ney\\'s corps was caught by surprise and attacked on the road from lützen to leipzig. on the eve of the battle, one of napoleon\\'s marshals, jean-baptiste bessières, was killed by a stray cannonball while reconnoitering near rippach.\\n\\nbattle.napoleon was visiting the 1632 battlefield, playing tour guide with his staff by pointing to the sites and describing the events of 1632, in detail from memory, when he heard the sound of cannon. he immediately cut the tour short and rode off towards the direction of the artillery fire. arriving on the scene, he quickly sized up the situation and decided to set a trap using ney\\'s corps as bait. he ordered the marshal to make a fighting withdrawal towards lützen. meanwhile, he sent ney reinforcements which would take up strong, defensive positions in and around two villages south of the city. once these divisions were ready, the rest of the corps would withdraw towards them, luring the allies to attack, while napoleon, leading the main 110,000 strong french force, would come around the allied flank and counterattack.\\n\\nwittgenstein and blücher took the bait, continuing to press ney until they ran into the \"hook\" napoleon had prepared. once their advance had halted, with the perfect timing of old, he struck. while he had been reinforcing ney, he had also concentrated a great mass of artillery (grande batterie) that unleashed a devastating barrage towards wittgenstein\\'s center. then napoleon himself, along with his imperial guard, led the massive counter assault into the allied flank. a prussian counterattack managed to halt the french offensive, and allow enough time for the main army to retreat. in addition, darkness was closing in. this allowed the allied force to retreat in good order. the lack of french cavalry meant there would be no pursuit. napoleon lost 19,655 men killed and wounded, while the prussians lost 8,500 men killed and wounded and the russians lost 3,500 men killed, wounded and missing. but casualties aside, by nightfall wittgenstein and blücher were in retreat while napoleon controlled lützen and the field.\\n\\naftermath.napoleon demonstrated his usual prowess in driving back the russo-prussian force at lützen, but the costliness of his victory had a major impact on the war. lützen was followed by the battle of bautzen eighteen days later, where napoleon was again victorious but with the loss of another 22,000 men, twice as many as the russo-prussian army. the ferocity of these two battles prompted napoleon to accept a temporary armistice on the 4 june with tsar alexander and king frederick william iii. this agreement provided the allies the respite to organise and re-equip their armies and, perhaps more importantly, encouraged britain to provide russia and prussia with war subsidies totalling seven million pounds. the financial security offered by this agreement was a major boon to the war effort against napoleon. another important result of the battle was that it encouraged austria to join the allied coalition and, when it did so on upon the armistice\\'s expiration, the balance of power had shifted dramatically in the coalition\\'s favor. due to these developments, napoleon later regarded his june 4 truce, bought at lützen and bautzen, as the undoing of his power in germany.\\n\\nduring the battle of lützen, gerhard von scharnhorst, one of the brightest and most able prussian generals, serving as wittgenstein\\'s chief of staff, was wounded. although the wound was minor, owing to the hasty retreat it could not be tended to soon enough. infection set in and he died as a result.\\n\\nbibliography.- clark, christopher c. iron kingdom: the

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'Battle of Hanau', 'contents': 'the battle of hanau was fought from 30 to 31 october 1813 between karl philipp von wrede’s austro-bavarian corps and napoleon\\'s retreating french during the war of the sixth coalition.\\n\\nfollowing napoleon\\'s defeat at the battle of leipzig earlier in october, napoleon began to retreat from germany into france and relative safety. wrede attempted to block napoleon’s line of retreat at hanau on 30 october. napoleon arrived at hanau with reinforcements and defeated wrede’s forces. on 31 october hanau was in french control, opening napoleon’s line of retreat.\\n\\nthe battle of hanau was a minor battle, but an important tactical victory allowing napoleon’s army to retreat onto french soil to recover and face the invasion of france.\\n\\nbackground.the battle of leipzig, the largest and bloodiest encounter of the napoleonic wars, began on 16 october 1813, raged for three days and ended with a decisive victory for the sixth coalition. napoleon was forced to abandon central germany to the coalition and hastily retreated westwards. his strategy was to regroup all his available forces on the shores of the rhine, where his lines of communication would be shorter and his rear less likely to be threatened. the emperor\\'s concern was that his already battered army might be forced to fight against superior forces again, so he ordered that the retreat be carried out at great speed. had the coalition managed to advance with more vigour in the days following the battle of leipzig, the already disorganised french army would probably have been destroyed, but the coalition armies themselves had suffered such high losses at leipzig that they were in no position to launch an effective pursuit. with military action confined to secondary rearguard actions, napoleon was able to install his headquarters at erfurt on 23 october and began to reorganise his forces. on 26 october, he sent orders to the various corps, directing them to frankfurt via eisenach and fulda. their assigned destination was the city of mainz, by the rhine river.\\n\\nthe coalition was buoyed by the news that bavaria, a former french ally, agreed to join the sixth coalition according to the treaty of ried concluded just before the battle of leipzig. this allowed the coalition to threaten the overall military position of the french by moving a 45,000 - 50,000 austro-bavarian army, under the command of karl philipp von wrede, into napoleon\\'s rear, occupying würzburg in franconia. the small french garrison of würzburg did not try to resist and instead barricaded themselves at the local citadel, allowing the enemy to occupy the town without a fight. from würzburg, wrede moved towards the strategic city of hanau, along one of napoleon\\'s main retreat routes. wrede’s advance guard reached hanau on 28 october and took possession of the city, blocking napoleon’s route to frankfurt. although wrede probably assumed that the main part of the french forces was retreating along a more northerly road to coblenz and thus expected to face a force of only 20,000 men, he did entertain hopes that he would be able to play a major role in the defeat of napoleon. he also believed that the french army was completely disorganised, which was not true, and was closely followed by the main coalition army, the \"army of bohemia\", which was in reality much further away and not really in close contact with napoleon\\'s forces.\\n\\ncoalition army.the austrian and bavarian army at the battle of hanau comprised two army corps, one austrian and one bavarian, and numbered no less than 42,000 men: 33,000 infantrymen, 9,000 cavalrymen and 94 artillery pieces. they were under the overall command of bavarian general karl philipp von wrede.\\n\\nthe austrian corps, under the command of field-marshal-lieutenant baron fresnet, numbered 24,000 men: 18,000 infantrymen (18 battalions), 6,000 cavalrymen (32 squadrons) and 34 artillery pieces. these men were organised in three divisions: the 1st division under general bach, the 2nd division under general trautenberg, and the 3rd division under general spleny (cavalry and reserve artillery). the bavarian corps, under wrede\\'s direct command, numbered 18,000 men: 15,000 infantrymen (17 battalions), 3,000 cavalrymen (20 squadrons), and 60 artillery pieces. these men were organised in two divisions, one cavalry reserve and one artillery reserve: the 2nd division was under general beckers, the 3rd division under general lamotte, the three-brigade cavalry reserve was under generals bieregg, ellbracht, dietz, and the artillery reserve was under general cologne.\\n\\nfrench army.the french grande armée had suffered horrendous casualties at the battle of leipzig, which left the french corps at a fraction of its prior strength. emperor napoleon i was in personal command of the french forces in the battle. they numbered between 40,000 and 50,000 men, but only a fraction of them were ready for combat, with napoleon able to count on little more than 30,000 men: the ii, v and xi army corps, the i and ii cavalry reserve corps and the imperial guard. guard units aside, many of the french battalions at hanau were only 100-man strong, and the cavalry squadrons were much smaller.\\n\\nof these men, only one division (general jean-louis dubreton\\'s, 15 battalions) of marshal claude victor-perrin\\'s iind corps, and another (general henri-françois-marie charpentier\\'s 11 battalions) of marshal macdonald xi corps, were committed to battle with a grand total of some 7,000-8,000 men. cavalry support came from sébastiani\\'s iind cavalry corps, some 3,000 sabres, and nansouty\\'s imperial guard cavalry, some 4,000 sabres. the entirety of the imperial guard infantry and artillery, some 6,000 men and 52 cannons, were also committed. napoleon thus commanded a total of about 20,000 men (40 battalions, 113 squadrons) at the battle of hanau.\\n\\npreliminaries.on 29 october, having correctly reckoned that his force was strong enough to block the retreat of a disorganised enemy army, wrede decided to give battle. he had plenty of time to prepare his dispositions and deployed his army in a relatively narrow and deep order, which was quite sensible, given that his intention was to remain on the defensive. wrede\\'s left covered the road to frankfurt and mainz, the main retreat route that the french wanted to take. the bulk of his force was positioned along the kinzig river, on the opposite bank from the city of hanau, while on his right the divisions of elbracht and trautenberg were positioned on the southern bank of the kinzig. beckers\\'s bavarian division constituted the far right and was deployed on either side of the kinzig. one regiment, the austrian szekler, two battalions strong, as well as a great many skirmishers detached from their parent units were placed in an advanced position in the lamboy forest. most of the cavalry was placed in the second line, in the centre, with the artillery quite evenly dispersed throughout the battlefield.\\n\\nmeanwhile, napoleon spent the night of 29/30 october at isenburg castle, near gelnhausen, and received detailed intelligence about the austro-bavarian preparations, which confirmed that the enemy was intending to make a stand. napoleon thus directed the army\\'s baggage and supply train northwards, away from the coalition forces, under the protection of jean-toussaint arrighi de casanova\\'s cavalry corps, while leading his remaining forces in a frontal manoeuvre against wrede\\'s force. he ordered victor to form the left wing with his army corps and march along the kinzig, while macdonald\\'s corps and the guard were to penetrate the lamboi forest. part of the guard cavalry under general charles lefebvre-desnouettes was detached further north to cover the flank of the army. napoleon studied wrede\\'s position and spotted its main weakness, namely that he had most of his army deployed with the river behind it, which would act as a natural barrier should retreat be necessary. upon seeing wrede\\'s dispositions, napoleon sarcastically noted: \"i have made wrede a count but it was beyond my power to make him a general.\" however, in order to exploit this potentially fatal weakness in wrede\\'s deployment, napoleon first had to beat him, and do so with an inferior number of infantry, less cavalry and fewer cannons, fighting against an enemy who had all the time it needed to deploy its forces for defense.\\n\\nbattle.wrede, following successful skirmishing against the french, began to deploy his forces to face the main french force of 20,000. on 30 october wrede placed his centre with the river kinzig behind it, and his right wing to its south in an isolated position with only a single bridge linking it with the main force. napoleon had only 17,000 troops including marshal macdonald’s infantry and general sébastiani’s cavalry to face the enemy forces blocking them. due to dense forests on the east of wrede’s positions the french were able to advance and make close contact with the allies almost unseen. napoleon decided to attack the allies\\' left with all available troops. by midday marshal victor and macdonald had cleared the forest in front of the allies\\' centre. soon after, general drouot found a track in the forest towards wrede’s left on which cannon could be moved. three hours later grenadiers of the old guard had cleared the area of allied troops and drouot began to deploy 50 cannons supported by cavalry of the guard and sébastiani. a brief artillery bombardment from drouot’s cannons silenced wrede’s 28 cannons. french cavalry then attacked and pushed back wrede’s cavalry on his left flank, then attacked the flank of wrede’s centre. wrede’s centre started to fall back, skirting the banks of the kinzig river and suffering heavy casualties. on the right wing, wrede’s forces tried to cross the single bridge over the kinzig river to reinforce the centre, but many drowned in the attempt. wrede was successful in rallying his troops to form a defensive line running from lamboy bridge to the town of hanau. during the night the allies abandoned hanau. the french occupied hanau on 31 october with little resistance. napoleon made no effort to pursue wrede, the main road to frankfurt was now reopened, the french retreat continued.\\n\\naftermath.wrede suffered 9,000 casualties, napoleon suffered fewer, but some 10,000 french stragglers became allied prisoners of war between 28 and 31 october. the french reached frankfurt on 2 november and were only 20\\xa0miles from their relatively safe rear base at mainz.\\n\\nnapoleon was not slowed or blocked or interfered with on his march to frankfurt, where he arrived in the afternoon of 31 october 1813. militarily the battle was a clear victory for napoleon. wrede failed to block napoleon\\'s path, although the allied forces of russians, prussians and austrians had cut napoleon\\'s line of retreat. however napoleon evaded the maneuver. the kingdom of bavaria wanted with this battle to support militarily its shift to the allied side. it did not really matter to the bavarian politicians and military whether the battle was won or lost—as long as it took place. overall, 4,500 french soldiers and 9,000 allied soldiers were lost in the battle. however, the allies were able to capture around 10,000 french stragglers. on 5 november 1813 alexander i marched with his troops into frankfurt.\\n\\nhonors.the best officers in the battle were honored by promotion and received many medals. for example, carl philipp von wrede received two medals from the austrian empire: the order of leopold and the commander\\'s cross of the military order of maria theresa and two from the russian empire: the order of alexander nevsky and the order of st. george.\\n\\nto commemorate the battle of hanau, memorials were erected in the city of hanau, five of which have been preserved: at lamboystrasse, karl-marx-strasse and robert blum strasse, and two more at the kinzig bridge. the battle is also immortalized at the arc de triomphe in paris in the list of battles won by napoleon.\\n\\nin 2015, around 200 remains of french soldiers fallen in the battle were exhumed at the battle\\'s site.\\n\\nreferences.- blond, g. la grande armée. castle books, 1979.\\n- chandler, d. the campaigns of napoleon. scribner, 1966.\\n- eggenberger, d. an encyclopedia of battles. dover publications

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'Battle of Kulm', 'contents': 'the battle of kulm was a battle near the town kulm (chlumec) and the village přestanov in northern bohemia. it was fought on 29–30 august 1813, during the war of the sixth coalition. 32,000 french troops under dominique vandamme attacked an army of about 50-60,000 austrians, russians and prussians under alexander ostermann-tolstoy, but were defeated with heavy losses on both sides.\\n\\nbackground.following the french victory at dresden, vandamme pursued the retreating allies. napoleon sent marshals gouvion saint cyr and auguste marmont to support vandamme\\'s corps. with vandamme in advance, saint cyr\\'s and marmont\\'s corps brought up the rear. vandamme caught up with alexander ivanovich ostermann-tolstoy\\'s forces near the town of kulm, eight kilometres northwest of aussig (ústí nad labem, now in the czech republic).\\n\\nbattle.on 29 august, vandamme, with 34,000 soldiers and 84 guns at his disposal, attacked russian formations forming a rearguard for the retreating coalition army, at 16,000 strong, under the command of russian general ostermann-tolstoy. the situation was very dangerous for the allies; if vandamme won the battle, the french would take the passes in the mountains, and the retreating coalition army could be trapped by napoleon. however, ostermann-tolstoy rallied all of his troops for a stiff defense, and soon vandamme\\'s troops were repulsed. vandamme\\'s situation changed the next day. a prussian army corp commanded by friedrich von kleist attacked vandamme\\'s rear guard. kleist then received help from a combined russian and austrian attack on his front, under the command of generals ostermann-tolstoy and von colloredo-mansfeld. in an attempt to repulse simultaneous attacks on his front and rear, vandamme ordered his forces to form squares. the inexperienced french troops were unable to fend off the allies, and soon withdrew from the battlefield, with heavy losses, including vandamme himself as a captured prisoner of war.\\n\\ncasualties.the french lost more than half of the pursuing force of 34,000; about 5,000 soldiers killed or wounded, and between 7,000 and 13,000 french soldiers were taken prisoner, including vandamme, and almost all of his artillery, 80 of his 84 guns, were captured. the allies lost approximately 13,000 soldiers killed or wounded.\\n\\nin vandamme\\'s corps there were two polish regiments of uhlans, part of cavalry divisions under the command of general jean corbineau. these regiments were used by vandamme to defend against enemy cavalry charges. one regiment, commanded by colonel maximilian fredro (brother of playwright alexander fredro), was attacked after withdrawing to a defile and surrendered. the other regiment of uhlans, under the command of count tomasz łubieński (generally known in english as thomas lubienski) successfully withdrew.\\n\\naftermath.while marshal macdonald\\'s defeat at katzbach coincided with napoleon\\'s victory at dresden, the coalition success at kulm eventually negated his triumph, given that his troops never completely crushed the enemy. thus, by winning this battle, ostermann-tolstoy and his troops succeeded in buying much needed time for the coalition armies to regroup after the battle of dresden.\\n\\ninsults.according to a french anecdote, after the battle vandamme was brought to and accused by emperor alexander i of russia of being a brigand and plunderer. he retorted, \"i am neither a plunderer nor a brigand, but in any case, my contemporaries and history will not reproach me for having murdered my own father.\" this statement apparently hinted at the widespread belief that alexander i was implicated in the murder of his father, emperor paul i.\\n\\nthe battlefield today.the battlefield is mostly built over. there is a large monument topped with a lion next door to the hotel napoleon.\\n\\nreferences.- jadwiga nadzieja \"lipsk 1813\" historical battles serie published in warsaw by bellona 1998 pp.\\xa057–59.\\n\\nexternal links.- battle of kulm\\n- memoirs of the duke rovigo'}\n",

            "Debug: Retrieved document: {'title': 'Max Müller', 'contents': 'friedrich max müller (; 6 december 1823\\xa0– 28 october 1900) was a german-born philologist and orientalist, who lived and studied in britain for most of his life. he was one of the founders of the western academic field of indian studies and the discipline of study of religions (science of religion, religionswissenschaft). müller wrote both scholarly and popular works on the subject of indology. the sacred books of the east, a 50-volume set of english translations, was prepared under his direction. he also promoted the idea of a turanian family of languages.\\n\\nearly life and education.max müller was born into a cultured family on 6 december 1823 in dessau, the son of wilhelm müller, a lyric poet whose verse franz schubert had set to music in his song-cycles die schöne müllerin and winterreise. his mother, adelheid müller (née von basedow), was the eldest daughter of a prime minister of anhalt-dessau. carl maria von weber was a godfather.\\n\\nmüller was named after his mother\\'s elder brother, friedrich, and after the central character, max, in weber\\'s opera der freischütz. later in life, he adopted max as a part of his surname, believing that the prevalence of müller as a name made it too common. his name was also recorded as \"maximilian\" on several official documents (e.g. university register, marriage certificate), on some of his honours and in some other publications.\\n\\nmüller entered the gymnasium (grammar school) at dessau when he was six years old. in 1829, after the death of his grandfather, he was sent to the nicolai school at leipzig, where he continued his studies of music and classics. it was during his time in leipzig that he frequently met felix mendelssohn.\\n\\nin need of a scholarship to attend leipzig university, müller successfully sat his abitur examination at zerbst. while preparing, he found that the syllabus differed from what he had been taught, necessitating that he rapidly learn mathematics, modern languages and science. he entered leipzig university in 1841 to study philology, leaving behind his early interest in music and poetry. müller received his degree in 1843. his final dissertation was on spinoza\\'s ethics. he also displayed an aptitude for classical languages, learning greek, latin, arabic, persian and sanskrit.\\n\\nacademic career.in 1850 müller was appointed deputy taylorian professor of modern european languages at oxford university. in the following year, at the suggestion of thomas gaisford, he was made an honorary m.a. and a member of the college of christ church, oxford. on succeeding to the full professorship in 1854, he received the full degree of m.a. by decree of convocation. in 1858 he was elected to a life fellowship at all souls\\' college.\\n\\nhe was defeated in the 1860 election for the boden professor of sanskrit, which was a \"keen disappointment\" to him. müller was far better qualified for the post than the other candidate (monier monier-williams), but his broad theological views, his lutheranism, his german birth and lack of practical first-hand knowledge of india told against him. after the election he wrote to his mother, \"all the best people voted for me, the professors almost unanimously, but the vulgus profanum made the majority\".\\n\\nlater in 1868, müller became oxford\\'s first professor of comparative philology, a position founded on his behalf. he held this chair until his death, although he retired from its active duties in 1875.\\n\\nsanskrit studies.in 1844, prior to commencing his academic career at oxford, müller studied in berlin with friedrich schelling. he began to translate the upanishads for schelling, and continued to research sanskrit under franz bopp, the first systematic scholar of the indo-european languages (ie). schelling led müller to relate the history of language to the history of religion. at this time, müller published his first book, a german translation of the hitopadesa, a collection of indian fables.\\n\\nin 1845 müller moved to paris to study sanskrit under eugène burnouf. burnouf encouraged him to publish the complete rigveda, making use of the manuscripts available in england. he moved to england in 1846 to study sanskrit texts in the collection of the east india company. he supported himself at first with creative writing, his novel german love being popular in its day.\\n\\nmüller\\'s connections with the east india company and with sanskritists based at oxford university led to a career in britain, where he eventually became the leading intellectual commentator on the culture of india. at the time, britain controlled this territory as part of its empire. this led to complex exchanges between indian and british intellectual culture, especially through müller\\'s links with the brahmo samaj.\\n\\nmüller\\'s sanskrit studies came at a time when scholars had started to see language development in relation to cultural development. the recent discovery of the indo-european language group had started to lead to much speculation about the relationship between greco-roman cultures and those of more ancient peoples. in particular the vedic culture of india was thought to have been the ancestor of european classical cultures. scholars sought to compare the genetically related european and asian languages to reconstruct the earliest form of the root-language. the vedic language, sanskrit, was thought to be the oldest of the ie languages.\\n\\nmüller devoted himself to the study of this language, becoming one of the major sanskrit scholars of his day. he believed that the earliest documents of vedic culture should be studied to provide the key to the development of pagan european religions, and of religious belief in general. to this end, müller sought to understand the most ancient of vedic scriptures, the rig-veda. müller was greatly impressed by ramakrishna paramhansa, his contemporary and proponent of vedantic philosophy, and wrote several essays and books about him.\\nfor müller, the study of the language had to relate to the study of the culture in which it had been used. he came to the view that the development of languages should be tied to that of belief-systems. at that time the vedic scriptures were little-known in the west, though there was increasing interest in the philosophy of the upanishads. müller believed that the sophisticated upanishadic philosophy could be linked to the primitive henotheism of early vedic brahmanism from which it evolved. he had to travel to london to look at documents held in the collection of the british east india company. while there he persuaded the company to allow him to undertake a critical edition of the rig-veda, a task he pursued over many years (1849–1874). he completed the critical edition for which he is most remembered..\\n\\nfor müller, the culture of the vedic peoples represented a form of nature worship, an idea clearly influenced by romanticism. müller shared many of the ideas associated with romanticism, which coloured his account of ancient religions, in particular his emphasis on the formative influence on early religion of emotional communion with natural forces. he saw the gods of the rig-veda as active forces of nature, only partly personified as imagined supernatural persons. from this claim müller derived his theory that mythology is \"a disease of language\". by this he meant that myth transforms concepts into beings and stories. in müller\\'s view, \"gods\" began as words constructed to express abstract ideas, but were transformed into imagined personalities. thus the indo-european father-god appears under various names: zeus, jupiter, dyaus pita. for müller all these names can be traced to the word \"dyaus\", which he understood to imply \"shining\" or \"radiance\". this leads to the terms \"deva\", \"deus\", \"theos\" as generic terms for a god, and to the names \"zeus\" and \"jupiter\" (derived from deus-pater). in this way a metaphor becomes personified and ossified. this aspect of müller\\'s thinking was later explored similarly by nietzsche.\\n\\ngifford lectures.in 1888, müller was appointed gifford lecturer at the university of glasgow. these gifford lectures were the first in an annual series, given at several scottish universities, that has continued to the present day. over the next four years, müller gave four series of lectures. the titles and order of the lectures were as follows:\\n\\n1. natural religion. this first course of lectures was intended as purely introductory, and had for its object a definition of natural religion in its widest sense.\\n2. physical religion. this second course of lectures was intended to show how different nations had arrived at a belief in something infinite behind the finite, in something invisible behind the visible, in many unseen agents or gods of nature, until they reached a belief in one god above all those gods. in short, a history of the discovery of the infinite in nature.\\n3. anthropological religion. this third course was intended to show how different nations arrived at a belief in a soul, how they named its various faculties, and what they imagined about its fate after death.\\n4. theosophy or psychological religion. the fourth and last course of lectures was intended to examine the relation between god and the soul (\"these two infinites\"), including the ideas that some of the principal nations of the world have formed concerning this relation. real religion, müller asserted, is founded on a true perception of the relation of the soul to god and of god to the soul; müller wanted to prove that this was true, not only as a postulate, but as an historical fact. the original title of the lectures was \\'psychological religion\\' but müller felt compelled to add \\'theosophy\\' to it. müller\\'s final gifford lecture is significant in interpreting his work broadly, as he situates his philological and historical research within a hermetic and mystical theological project.\\n\\nas translator.in 1881, he published a translation of the first edition of kant\\'s critique of pure reason. he agreed with schopenhauer that this edition was the most direct and honest expression of kant\\'s thought. his translation corrected several errors that were committed by previous translators. in his translator\\'s preface, müller wrote \\nmüller continued to be influenced by the kantian transcendentalist model of spirituality, and was opposed to darwinian ideas of human development. he argued that \"language forms an impassable barrier between man and beast.\"\\n\\nhe was also influenced by the work thought and reality, of the russian philosopher african spir. \\n\\nearly career.on august 25th 1866, muller wrote to chevalier bunsen:\\nin his career, müller several times expressed the view that a \"reformation\" within hinduism needed to occur, comparable to the christian reformation. in his view, \"if there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed...\\xa0whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states\".\\n\\nhe used his links with the brahmo samaj to encourage such a reformation on the lines pioneered by ram mohan roy. müller believed that the brahmos would engender an indian form of christianity and that they were in practice \"christians, without being roman catholics, anglicans or lutherans\". in the lutheran tradition, he hoped that the \"superstition\" and idolatry, which he considered to be characteristic of modern popular hinduism, would disappear.\\n\\nmüller wrote: \\nthe translation of the veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of india, and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. it is the root of their religion, and to show them what the root is, is, i feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years... one ought to be up and doing what may be god\\'s work.\\n\\nmüller hoped that increased funding for education in india would promote a new form of literature combining western and indian traditions. in 1868 he wrote to george campbell, the newly appointed secretary of state for india:\\n\\nlate career.in his sixties and seventies, müller gave a series of lectures, which reflected a more nuanced view in favour of hinduism and the ancient literature from india. in his \"what can india teach us?\" lecture at university of cambridge, he championed ancient sanskrit literature and india as follows:\\n\\nhe also conjectured that the introduction of islam in india in the 11th century had a deep effect on the psyche and behaviour of hindus in another lecture, \"truthful character of the hindus\":\\n\\nswami vivekananda, who was the foremost disciple of ramakrishna paramahamsa, met müller over a lunch on 28 may 1896. regarding müller and his wife, the swami later wrote:\\n\\nanti-christian.during the course of his gifford lectures on the subject of \"natural religion\", müller was severely criticised for being anti-christian. in 1891, at a meeting of the established presbytery of glasgow, mr. thomson (minister of ladywell) moved a motion that müller\\'s teaching was \"subversive of the christian faith, and fitted to spread pantheistic and infidel views amongst the students and others\" and questioned müller\\'s appointment as lecturer. an even stronger attack on müller was made by monsignor alexander munro in st andrew\\'s cathedral. munro, an officer of the roman catholic church in scotland (and provost of the catholic cathedral of glasgow from 1884 to 1892), declared that müller\\'s lectures \"were nothing less than a crusade against divine revelation, against jesus christ, and against christianity\". the blasphemous lectures were, he continued, \"the proclamation of atheism under the guise of pantheism\" and \"uprooted our idea of god, for it repudiated the idea of a personal god\".\\n\\nsimilar accusations had already led to müller\\'s exclusion from the boden chair in sanskrit in favour of the conservative monier monier-williams. by the 1880s müller was being courted by charles godfrey leland, medium and freemason helena blavatsky, and other writers who were seeking to assert the merits of \"pagan\" religious traditions over christianity. the designer mary fraser tytler stated that müller\\'s book chips from a german workshop (a collection of his essays) was her \"bible\", which helped her to create a multi-cultural sacred imagery.\\n\\nmüller distanced himself from these developments, and remained within the lutheran faith in which he had been brought up. according to g. beckerlegge, \"müller\\'s background as a lutheran german and his identification with the broad church party\" led to \"suspicion by those opposed to the political and religious positions that they felt müller represented\", particularly his latitudinarianism.\\n\\nalthough müller took a strong religious and academic interest in hinduism and other non-christian religions, and often compared christianity to religions that many traditional protestants would have regarded as primitive or false, he grounded his perennialism in a belief that christianity possessed the fullest truth of all living religions. twenty-first century scholars of religion, far from accusing müller of being anti-christian, have critically examined müller\\'s theological project as evidence for a bias towards christian conceptions of god in early academic religious studies.\\n\\ndarwin disagreement.müller attempted to formulate a philosophy of religion that addressed the crisis of faith engendered by the historical and critical study of religion by german scholars on the one hand, and by the darwinian revolution on the other. he was wary of darwin\\'s work on human evolution, and attacked his view of the development of human faculties. his work was taken up by cultural commentators such as his friend john ruskin, who saw it as a productive response to the crisis of the age (compare matthew arnold\\'s \"dover beach\"). he analysed mythologies as rationalisations of natural phenomena, primitive beginnings that we might denominate \"protoscience\" within a cultural evolution. müller also proposed an early, mystical interpretation of theistic evolution, using darwinism as a critique of mechanical philosophy.\\n\\nin 1870 müller gave a short course of three lectures for the british institution on language as the barrier between man and beast, which he called \"on darwin\\'s philosophy of language\". müller specifically disagreed with darwin\\'s theories on the origin of language and that the language of man could have developed from the language of animals. in 1873, he sent a copy of his lectures to darwin reassuring him that, though he differed from some of darwin\\'s conclusions, he was one of his \"diligent readers and sincere admirers\".\\n\\naryanism.müller\\'s work contributed to the developing interest in aryan culture, which often set indo-european (\"aryan\") traditions in opposition to semitic religions. he was \"deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms\", as this was far from his intention. for müller the discovery of common indian and european ancestry was a powerful argument against racism, arguing that \"an ethnologist who speaks of aryan race, aryan blood, aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar\" and that \"the blackest hindus represent an earlier stage of aryan speech and thought than the fairest scandinavians\".\\n\\nturanian.müller put forward and promoted the theory of a \"turanian\" family of languages or speech, comprising the finnic, samoyedic, \"tataric\" (turkic), mongolic, and tungusic languages. according to müller these five languages were those \"spoken in asia or europe not included under the arian (sic) and semitic families, with the exception perhaps of the chinese and its dialects\". in addition, they were \"nomadic languages,\" in contrast to the other two families (aryan and semitic), which he called state or political languages.\\n\\nthe idea of a turanian family of languages was not accepted by everyone at the time. although the term \"turanian\" quickly became an archaism (unlike \"aryan\"), it did not disappear completely. the idea was absorbed later into nationalist ideologies in hungary and turkey.\\n\\nhonours.in 1869 müller was elected to the french académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres as a foreign correspondent (associé étranger).\\n\\nin june 1874 müller was awarded the pour le mérite (civil class), much to his surprise. soon after, when he was commanded to dine at windsor, he wrote to prince leopold to ask if he might wear his order, and the wire came back, \"not may, but must.\"\\n\\nin 1875 müller was awarded the bavarian maximilian order for science and art. the award is given to acknowledge excellent and outstanding achievements in the field of science and art. in a letter to his mother dated 19 december, müller wrote that the award was more showy than the pour le mérite, \"but that is the best\".\\n\\nin 1896 müller was appointed a member of the privy council.\\n\\npersonal life.müller became a naturalized british citizen in 1855, at the age of 32.\\n\\nhe married georgina adelaide grenfell on 3 august 1859. the couple had four children – ada, mary, beatrice and wilhelm max – of whom two predeceased them.\\n\\ngeorgina (died 1919) had his papers and correspondence bound; they are at the bodleian library, oxford.\\n\\ndeath and legacy.müller\\'s health began deteriorating in 1898 and he died at his home in oxford on 28 october 1900. he was interred at holywell cemetery on 1 november 1900.\\n\\nafter his death a memorial fund was opened at oxford for \"the promotion of learning and research in all matters relating to the history and archaeology, the languages, literatures, and religions of ancient india\".\\n\\nthe goethe institutes in india are named max müller bhavan in his honour, as is a street (max mueller marg) in new delhi.\\n\\nmüller\\'s biographies include those by lourens van den bosch (2002), jon r. stone (2002) and nirad c. chaudhuri (1974), the last of which was awarded the sahitya akademi award for english by sahitya akademi, india\\'s national academy of letters. stephen g. alter\\'s (2005) work contains a chapter on müller\\'s rivalry with the american linguist william dwight

studied in britain for most of his life. he was one of the founders of the western academic field of indian studies and the discipline of study of religions (science of religion, religionswissenschaft). müller wrote both scholarly and popular works on the subject of indology. the sacred books of the east, a 50-volume set of english translations, was prepared under his direction. he also promoted the idea of a turanian family of languages.\\n\\nearly life and education.max müller was born into a cultured family on 6 december 1823 in dessau, the son of wilhelm müller, a lyric poet whose verse franz schubert had set to music in his song-cycles die schöne müllerin and winterreise. his mother, adelheid müller (née von basedow), was the eldest daughter of a prime minister of anhalt-dessau. carl maria von weber was a godfather.\\n\\nmüller was named after his mother\\'s elder brother, friedrich, and after the central character, max, in weber\\'s opera der freischütz. later in life, he adopted max as a part of his surname, believing that the prevalence of müller as a name made it too common. his name was also recorded as \"maximilian\" on several official documents (e.g. university register, marriage certificate), on some of his honours and in some other publications.\\n\\nmüller entered the gymnasium (grammar school) at dessau when he was six years old. in 1829, after the death of his grandfather, he was sent to the nicolai school at leipzig, where he continued his studies of music and classics. it was during his time in leipzig that he frequently met felix mendelssohn.\\n\\nin need of a scholarship to attend leipzig university, müller successfully sat his abitur examination at zerbst. while preparing, he found that the syllabus differed from what he had been taught, necessitating that he rapidly learn mathematics, modern languages and science. he entered leipzig university in 1841 to study philology, leaving behind his early interest in music and poetry. müller received his degree in 1843. his final dissertation was on spinoza\\'s ethics. he also displayed an aptitude for classical languages, learning greek, latin, arabic, persian and sanskrit.\\n\\nacademic career.in 1850 müller was appointed deputy taylorian professor of modern european languages at oxford university. in the following year, at the suggestion of thomas gaisford, he was made an honorary m.a. and a member of the college of christ church, oxford. on succeeding to the full professorship in 1854, he received the full degree of m.a. by decree of convocation. in 1858 he was elected to a life fellowship at all souls\\' college.\\n\\nhe was defeated in the 1860 election for the boden professor of sanskrit, which was a \"keen disappointment\" to him. müller was far better qualified for the post than the other candidate (monier monier-williams), but his broad theological views, his lutheranism, his german birth and lack of practical first-hand knowledge of india told against him. after the election he wrote to his mother, \"all the best people voted for me, the professors almost unanimously, but the vulgus profanum made the majority\".\\n\\nlater in 1868, müller became oxford\\'s first professor of comparative philology, a position founded on his behalf. he held this chair until his death, although he retired from its active duties in 1875.\\n\\nsanskrit studies.in 1844, prior to commencing his academic career at oxford, müller studied in berlin with friedrich schelling. he began to translate the upanishads for schelling, and continued to research sanskrit under franz bopp, the first systematic scholar of the indo-european languages (ie). schelling led müller to relate the history of language to the history of religion. at this time, müller published his first book, a german translation of the hitopadesa, a collection of indian fables.\\n\\nin 1845 müller moved to paris to study sanskrit under eugène burnouf. burnouf encouraged him to publish the complete rigveda, making use of the manuscripts available in england. he moved to england in 1846 to study sanskrit texts in the collection of the east india company. he supported himself at first with creative writing, his novel german love being popular in its day.\\n\\nmüller\\'s connections with the east india company and with sanskritists based at oxford university led to a career in britain, where he eventually became the leading intellectual commentator on the culture of india. at the time, britain controlled this territory as part of its empire. this led to complex exchanges between indian and british intellectual culture, especially through müller\\'s links with the brahmo samaj.\\n\\nmüller\\'s sanskrit studies came at a time when scholars had started to see language development in relation to cultural development. the recent discovery of the indo-european language group had started to lead to much speculation about the relationship between greco-roman cultures and those of more ancient peoples. in particular the vedic culture of india was thought to have been the ancestor of european classical cultures. scholars sought to compare the genetically related european and asian languages to reconstruct the earliest form of the root-language. the vedic language, sanskrit, was thought to be the oldest of the ie languages.\\n\\nmüller devoted himself to the study of this language, becoming one of the major sanskrit scholars of his day. he believed that the earliest documents of vedic culture should be studied to provide the key to the development of pagan european religions, and of religious belief in general. to this end, müller sought to understand the most ancient of vedic scriptures, the rig-veda. müller was greatly impressed by ramakrishna paramhansa, his contemporary and proponent of vedantic philosophy, and wrote several essays and books about him.\\nfor müller, the study of the language had to relate to the study of the culture in which it had been used. he came to the view that the development of languages should be tied to that of belief-systems. at that time the vedic scriptures were little-known in the west, though there was increasing interest in the philosophy of the upanishads. müller believed that the sophisticated upanishadic philosophy could be linked to the primitive henotheism of early vedic brahmanism from which it evolved. he had to travel to london to look at documents held in the collection of the british east india company. while there he persuaded the company to allow him to undertake a critical edition of the rig-veda, a task he pursued over many years (1849–1874). he completed the critical edition for which he is most remembered..\\n\\nfor müller, the culture of the vedic peoples represented a form of nature worship, an idea clearly influenced by romanticism. müller shared many of the ideas associated with romanticism, which coloured his account of ancient religions, in particular his emphasis on the formative influence on early religion of emotional communion with natural forces. he saw the gods of the rig-veda as active forces of nature, only partly personified as imagined supernatural persons. from this claim müller derived his theory that mythology is \"a disease of language\". by this he meant that myth transforms concepts into beings and stories. in müller\\'s view, \"gods\" began as words constructed to express abstract ideas, but were transformed into imagined personalities. thus the indo-european father-god appears under various names: zeus, jupiter, dyaus pita. for müller all these names can be traced to the word \"dyaus\", which he understood to imply \"shining\" or \"radiance\". this leads to the terms \"deva\", \"deus\", \"theos\" as generic terms for a god, and to the names \"zeus\" and \"jupiter\" (derived from deus-pater). in this way a metaphor becomes personified and ossified. this aspect of müller\\'s thinking was later explored similarly by nietzsche.\\n\\ngifford lectures.in 1888, müller was appointed gifford lecturer at the university of glasgow. these gifford lectures were the first in an annual series, given at several scottish universities, that has continued to the present day. over the next four years, müller gave four series of lectures. the titles and order of the lectures were as follows:\\n\\n1. natural religion. this first course of lectures was intended as purely introductory, and had for its object a definition of natural religion in its widest sense.\\n2. physical religion. this second course of lectures was intended to show how different nations had arrived at a belief in something infinite behind the finite, in something invisible behind the visible, in many unseen agents or gods of nature, until they reached a belief in one god above all those gods. in short, a history of the discovery of the infinite in nature.\\n3. anthropological religion. this third course was intended to show how different nations arrived at a belief in a soul, how they named its various faculties, and what they imagined about its fate after death.\\n4. theosophy or psychological religion. the fourth and last course of lectures was intended to examine the relation between god and the soul (\"these two infinites\"), including the ideas that some of the principal nations of the world have formed concerning this relation. real religion, müller asserted, is founded on a true perception of the relation of the soul to god and of god to the soul; müller wanted to prove that this was true, not only as a postulate, but as an historical fact. the original title of the lectures was \\'psychological religion\\' but müller felt compelled to add \\'theosophy\\' to it. müller\\'s final gifford lecture is significant in interpreting his work broadly, as he situates his philological and historical research within a hermetic and mystical theological project.\\n\\nas translator.in 1881, he published a translation of the first edition of kant\\'s critique of pure reason. he agreed with schopenhauer that this edition was the most direct and honest expression of kant\\'s thought. his translation corrected several errors that were committed by previous translators. in his translator\\'s preface, müller wrote \\nmüller continued to be influenced by the kantian transcendentalist model of spirituality, and was opposed to darwinian ideas of human development. he argued that \"language forms an impassable barrier between man and beast.\"\\n\\nhe was also influenced by the work thought and reality, of the russian philosopher african spir. \\n\\nearly career.on august 25th 1866, muller wrote to chevalier bunsen:\\nin his career, müller several times expressed the view that a \"reformation\" within hinduism needed to occur, comparable to the christian reformation. in his view, \"if there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed...\\xa0whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states\".\\n\\nhe used his links with the brahmo samaj to encourage such a reformation on the lines pioneered by ram mohan roy. müller believed that the brahmos would engender an indian form of christianity and that they were in practice \"christians, without being roman catholics, anglicans or lutherans\". in the lutheran tradition, he hoped that the \"superstition\" and idolatry, which he considered to be characteristic of modern popular hinduism, would disappear.\\n\\nmüller wrote: \\nthe translation of the veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of india, and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. it is the root of their religion, and to show them what the root is, is, i feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years... one ought to be up and doing what may be god\\'s work.\\n\\nmüller hoped that increased funding for education in india would promote a new form of literature combining western and indian traditions. in 1868 he wrote to george campbell, the newly appointed secretary of state for india:\\n\\nlate career.in his sixties and seventies, müller gave a series of lectures, which reflected a more nuanced view in favour of hinduism and the ancient literature from india. in his \"what can india teach us?\" lecture at university of cambridge, he championed ancient sanskrit literature and india as follows:\\n\\nhe also conjectured that the introduction of islam in india in the 11th century had a deep effect on the psyche and behaviour of hindus in another lecture, \"truthful character of the hindus\":\\n\\nswami vivekananda, who was the foremost disciple of ramakrishna paramahamsa, met müller over a lunch on 28 may 1896. regarding müller and his wife, the swami later wrote:\\n\\nanti-christian.during the course of his gifford lectures on the subject of \"natural religion\", müller was severely criticised for being anti-christian. in 1891, at a meeting of the established presbytery of glasgow, mr. thomson (minister of ladywell) moved a motion that müller\\'s teaching was \"subversive of the christian faith, and fitted to spread pantheistic and infidel views amongst the students and others\" and questioned müller\\'s appointment as lecturer. an even stronger attack on müller was made by monsignor alexander munro in st andrew\\'s cathedral. munro, an officer of the roman catholic church in scotland (and provost of the catholic cathedral of glasgow from 1884 to 1892), declared that müller\\'s lectures \"were nothing less than a crusade against divine revelation, against jesus christ, and against christianity\". the blasphemous lectures were, he continued, \"the proclamation of atheism under the guise of pantheism\" and \"uprooted our idea of god, for it repudiated the idea of a personal god\".\\n\\nsimilar accusations had already led to müller\\'s exclusion from the boden chair in sanskrit in favour of the conservative monier monier-williams. by the 1880s müller was being courted by charles godfrey leland, medium and freemason helena blavatsky, and other writers who were seeking to assert the merits of \"pagan\" religious traditions over christianity. the designer mary fraser tytler stated that müller\\'s book chips from a german workshop (a collection of his essays) was her \"bible\", which helped her to create a multi-cultural sacred imagery.\\n\\nmüller distanced himself from these developments, and remained within the lutheran faith in which he had been brought up. according to g. beckerlegge, \"müller\\'s background as a lutheran german and his identification with the broad church party\" led to \"suspicion by those opposed to the political and religious positions that they felt müller represented\", particularly his latitudinarianism.\\n\\nalthough müller took a strong religious and academic interest in hinduism and other non-christian religions, and often compared christianity to religions that many traditional protestants would have regarded as primitive or false, he grounded his perennialism in a belief that christianity possessed the fullest truth of all living religions. twenty-first century scholars of religion, far from accusing müller of being anti-christian, have critically examined müller\\'s theological project as evidence for a bias towards christian conceptions of god in early academic religious studies.\\n\\ndarwin disagreement.müller attempted to formulate a philosophy of religion that addressed the crisis of faith engendered by the historical and critical study of religion by german scholars on the one hand, and by the darwinian revolution on the other. he was wary of darwin\\'s work on human evolution, and attacked his view of the development of human faculties. his work was taken up by cultural commentators such as his friend john ruskin, who saw it as a productive response to the crisis of the age (compare matthew arnold\\'s \"dover beach\"). he analysed mythologies as rationalisations of natural phenomena, primitive beginnings that we might denominate \"protoscience\" within a cultural evolution. müller also proposed an early, mystical interpretation of theistic evolution, using darwinism as a critique of mechanical philosophy.\\n\\nin 1870 müller gave a short course of three lectures for the british institution on language as the barrier between man and beast, which he called \"on darwin\\'s philosophy of language\". müller specifically disagreed with darwin\\'s theories on the origin of language and that the language of man could have developed from the language of animals. in 1873, he sent a copy of his lectures to darwin reassuring him that, though he differed from some of darwin\\'s conclusions, he was one of his \"diligent readers and sincere admirers\".\\n\\naryanism.müller\\'s work contributed to the developing interest in aryan culture, which often set indo-european (\"aryan\") traditions in opposition to semitic religions. he was \"deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms\", as this was far from his intention. for müller the discovery of common indian and european ancestry was a powerful argument against racism, arguing that \"an ethnologist who speaks of aryan race, aryan blood, aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar\" and that \"the blackest hindus represent an earlier stage of aryan speech and thought than the fairest scandinavians\".\\n\\nturanian.müller put forward and promoted the theory of a \"turanian\" family of languages or speech, comprising the finnic, samoyedic, \"tataric\" (turkic), mongolic, and tungusic languages. according to müller these five languages were those \"spoken in asia or europe not included under the arian (sic) and semitic families, with the exception perhaps of the chinese and its dialects\". in addition, they were \"nomadic languages,\" in contrast to the other two families (aryan and semitic), which he called state or political languages.\\n\\nthe idea of a turanian family of languages was not accepted by everyone at the time. although the term \"turanian\" quickly became an archaism (unlike \"aryan\"), it did not disappear completely. the idea was absorbed later into nationalist ideologies in hungary and turkey.\\n\\nhonours.in 1869 müller was elected to the french académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres as a foreign correspondent (associé étranger).\\n\\nin june 1874 müller was awarded the pour le mérite (civil class), much to his surprise. soon after, when he was commanded to dine at windsor, he wrote to prince leopold to ask if he might wear his order, and the wire came back, \"not may, but must.\"\\n\\nin 1875 müller was awarded the bavarian maximilian order for science and art. the award is given to acknowledge excellent and outstanding achievements in the field of science and art. in a letter to his mother dated 19 december, müller wrote that the award was more showy than the pour le mérite, \"but that is the best\".\\n\\nin 1896 müller was appointed a member of the privy council.\\n\\npersonal life.müller became a naturalized british citizen in 1855, at the age of 32.\\n\\nhe married georgina adelaide grenfell on 3 august 1859. the couple had four children – ada, mary, beatrice and wilhelm max – of whom two predeceased them.\\n\\ngeorgina (died 1919) had his papers and correspondence bound; they are at the bodleian library, oxford.\\n\\ndeath and legacy.müller\\'s health began deteriorating in 1898 and he died at his home in oxford on 28 october 1900. he was interred at holywell cemetery on 1 november 1900.\\n\\nafter his death a memorial fund was opened at oxford for \"the promotion of learning and research in all matters relating to the history and archaeology, the languages, literatures, and religions of ancient india\".\\n\\nthe goethe institutes in india are named max müller bhavan in his honour, as is a street (max mueller marg) in new delhi.\\n\\nmüller\\'s biographies include those by lourens van den bosch (2002), jon r. stone (2002) and nirad c. chaudhuri (1974), the last of which was awarded the sahitya akademi award for english by sahitya akademi, india\\'s national academy of letters. stephen g. alter\\'s (2005) work contains a chapter on müller\\'s rivalry with the american linguist william dwight
