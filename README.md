# QA-SearchQuality

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate the quality of various search engines within multi-agent question and answer (QA) systems. The goal is to identify the most effective search engines for retrieving accurate, relevant, and timely information in response to queries handled by agents.

*Baseline_Projeto_Final_ia024_part2*: This notebook implements code to establish and evaluate baseline values using the MonoT5 search model on golden linked articles from the IIRC dataset.

*Projeto_Final_ia024_part2*: This notebook extends the baseline evaluation by comparing multiple search models, including BM25, monoT5 variants (small, base, large), and inranker variants (small, base). The notebook processes an evaluation dataset to generate predictions, logs the search process, and calculates various metrics such as the number of search rounds, prediction accuracy, and context relevance. The results are then used to compare the performance and cost-effectiveness of different search models.
